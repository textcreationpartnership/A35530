            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRANSLATOR TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is now Seven and Twenty Years, ſince the Moon appeared firſt Hiſtorically on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horizon: And let it not ſeem ſtrange, that ſhe ſhould have retained Light and Brightneſs ſo long here, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vovation; when we find by Experience, that in the Heavens, ſhe never fails once a Month to change and ſhift her Splendor. For it is the Excellency of Art, to repreſent Nature, even in her abſence; and this being a Piece done to the Life, by one that had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the true Light, as well as the Skill of Drawing, in this kind, to Perfection; he left ſo good an Original, which was ſo well Copied by another Hand, that the Picture
<pb facs="tcp:57769:3"/> might have ſerved for many Years more, to have given the Lovers of the Moon, a ſight of their Mistreſs, even in the darkeſt Nights; and when ſhe was retired to put on a clean Smock in <hi>Phoebus</hi> his Apartment; if they had been ſo curious, as to have encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the Expoſers.</p>
            <p>However, Reader, you have now a ſecond View of her, and that under the ſame Cover with the Sun too, which is very rare; ſince theſe two were never ſeen before in Conjunction. Yet I would have none be afraid, that their Eyes being dazled with the glorious Light of the Sun, they ſhould not ſee her; for Fancy will ſupply the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Organ, and Imagination, by the help of this Mirrour, will not fail to diſcover them both; though <hi>Cynthia</hi> lye hid under <hi>Apollo</hi>'s ſhining Mantle. And ſo much for the Luminaries.</p>
            <p>Now as to the <hi>Worlds,</hi> which, with Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to ours below, I may call the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New;</hi> that of the Moon having been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, tho imperfectly, by others, but the Sun owing its Diſcovery wholly to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: I make no doubt, but the Ingenious Reader will find in both, ſo extraordinary and ſurprizing Rarities, as well Natural, Moral, as Civil; that if he be not as yet ſufficiently diſgusted with this lower World,
<pb facs="tcp:57769:3"/> (which I am ſure ſome are) to think of making a Voyage thither, as our Author has done; he will at leaſt be pleaſed with his Relations. Nevertheleſs, ſince this Age produces a great many bold Wits, that ſhoot even beyond the Moon, and cannot endure, (no more than our Author) to be ſtinted by Magiſterial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to believe nothing but what Gray-headed Antiquity gives them leave: It's pity ſome ſoaring
<hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> inſtead of Travelling into <hi>France,</hi> does not take a flight up to the Sun; and by new Obſervations ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defects of its Hiſtory; occaſioned not by the Negligence of our Witty <hi>French</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, but by the accurſed Plagiary of ſome rude Hand, that in his Sickneſs, rifled his Trunks, and stole his Papers, as he himſelf complains.</p>
            <p>Let ſome venturous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaker auſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly attempt it then; and if neither of the two <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, <hi>Greſham</hi>-Colledge, nor <hi>Greenwich</hi>-Obſervatory can furniſh him with an Inſtrument of Conveyance; let him try his own Invention, or make uſe of our Author's Machine: For our Loſs is, indeed, ſo great, that one would think, none but the declared E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of Mankind, would have had the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, to purloyn and ſtiffle thoſe rare Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which our Author made in the Province of the Solar Philoſophers; and which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb facs="tcp:57769:4"/> would have gone far, as to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleing our Sublunary Philoſophy, which, as well as Religion, is lamentably rent by Sects and Whimſeys; and have convinced us, perhaps, that in our preſent Doubts and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, a little more, or a little leſs of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would better ſerve our Turns, and more content our Minds.</p>

                  <head>THE Comical HISTORY OF THE STATE AND EMPIRE OF THE WORLD OF THE MOON.</head>
                  <p>I Had been with ſome Friends at <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mard,</hi> a Houſe near <hi>Paris,</hi> and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently Entertain'd there by <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Guigy,</hi> the Lord of it; when upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57769:6"/> our return home, about Nine of the Clock at Night, the Air ſerene, and the Moon in the Full, the Contemplation of that bright Luminary, furniſhed us with ſuch variety of Thoughts, as made the way ſeem ſhorter than, indeed, it was. Our Eyes being fixed upon that ſtately Planet, every one ſpoke what he thought of it: One would needs have it be a Garret Window of Heaven; another preſently affirmed, That it was the Pan whereupon <hi>Diana</hi> ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Bands; whilſt another was of Opinion, That it might very well be the Sun himſelf, who putting his Locks up under his Cap at Night, peeped through a hole, to obſerve what was doing in the World, during his abſence: And for my part, Gentlemen, ſaid I, that I may put in for a ſhare, and gueſs with the reſt; not to amuſe my ſelf with thoſe curious Notions, wherewith you tickle and ſpur on ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paced Time; I believe, that the Moon is a World like ours, to which this of ours ſerves likewiſe for a Moon. This was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with the general Laughter of the Company. And perhaps, ſaid I, (Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen) juſt ſo they laugh now in the Moon, at ſome who maintain, That this Globe, where we are, is a World. But I'd as good have ſaid nothing, as have alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, That a great many Learned
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57769:6"/> Men had been of the ſame Opinion; for that only made them laugh the faſter. However, this thought, which becauſe of its boldneſs ſuted my Humor, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Contradiction, ſunk ſo deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my mind, that during the reſt of the way, I was big with Definitions of the Moon, which I could not be delivered of: Inſomuch that by ſtriving to verifie this Comical Fancy, by Reaſons of appearing weight, I had almoſt perſwaded my ſelf already of the truth on't; when a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, Accident, Providence, Fortune, or what, perhaps, ſome may call Viſion, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Fiction, Whimſey, or (if you will) Folly, furniſhed me with an occaſion, that engaged me into this Diſcourſe. Being come home, I went up into my Cloſet, where I found a Book open upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which I had not put there. It was a piece of <hi>Cardanus;</hi> and though I had no deſign to read in it, yet I fell at firſt ſight, as by force, exactly upon a Paſſage of that Philoſopher, where he tells us, That Study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one evening by Candle-light, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Two tall old Men, enter in through the door that was ſhut, who after many que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions that he put to them, made him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That they were Inhabitants of the Moon, and thereupon immediately diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. I was ſo ſurpriſed, not only to ſee
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57769:7"/> a Book get thither of it ſelf; but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the nicking of the Time ſo patly, and of the Page, at which it lay open, that I looked upon that Concatenation of Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as a Revelation, diſcovering to Mortals, that the Moon is a World. How! ſaid I to my ſelf, having juſt now talked of a thing, can a Book, which, perhaps, is the only Book in the World, that treats of that matter ſo particularly, fly down from the Shelf upon my Table, become capable of Reaſon, in opening ſo exactly at the place of ſo ſtrange an adventure; force my Eyes in a manner to look upon it, and then to ſuggeſt to my fancy the Reflexions, and to my Will the Deſigns which I hatch: Without doubt, continued I, the Two old Men, who appeared to that famous Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, are the very ſame who have taken down my Book, and opened it at that Page, to ſave themſelves the labour of making to me the Harangue, which they made to <hi>Cardan.</hi> But, added I, I cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved of this Doubt, unleſs I mount up thither: And why not? ſaid I inſtantly to my ſelf. <hi>Promethus</hi> heretofore went up to Heaven, and ſtole fire from thence. Have not I as much Boldneſs as he? And why ſhould not I, then, expect as favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Succeſs?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57769:7"/> After theſe ſudden ſtarts of Imagination, which may be termed, perhaps, the Rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a violent Feaver, I began to conceive ſome hopes of ſucceeding in ſo fair a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: Inſomuch that to take my meaſures aright, I ſhut my ſelf up in a ſolitary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-houſe; where having flattered my fancy with ſome means, proportionated to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, at length I ſet out for Heaven in this manner.</p>
                  <p>I planted my ſelf in the middle of a great many Glaſſes full of Dew, tied faſt about me; upon which the Sun ſo violently dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Rays, that the Heat which attracted them, as it does the thickeſt Clouds, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me up ſo high, that at length I found my ſelf above the middle Region of the Air. But ſeeing that Attraction hurried me up with ſo much rapidity, that inſtead of drawing near the Moon, as I intended, ſhe ſeem'd to me to be more diſtant, than at my firſt ſetting out; I broke ſeveral of my Vials, until I found my weight exceed the force of the Attraction, and that I began to deſcend again towards the Earth. I was not miſtaken in my opinion, for ſome time after I fell to the ground again; and to reckon from the hour that I ſet out at, it muſt then have been about midnight. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs I found the Sun to be in the Meridian, and that it was Noon. I leave
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57769:8"/> it to you to judge, in what Amazement I was: The truth is, I was ſo ſtrangely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, that not knowing what to think of that Miracle, I had the inſolence to imagine, that in favour of my Boldneſs, God had once more nailed the Sun to the Firmament, to light ſo generous an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. That which encreaſed my Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, That I knew not the Country where I was; it ſeemed to me, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mounted ſtraight up, I ſhould have fallen down again in the ſame place I parted from. However, in the Equipage I was in, I directed my courſe towards a kind of Cottage, where I perceived ſome ſmoke; and I was not above a Piſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot from it, when I ſaw my ſelf envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned by a great number of People, ſtark naked: They ſeemed to be exceedingly ſurpriſed at the ſight of me; for I was the firſt, (as I think) that they had ever ſeen clad in Bottles. Nay, and to baffle all the Interpretations, that they could put upon that Equipage, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that I hardly touched the ground as I walked; for, indeed, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not, that upon the leaſt agitation I gave my Body, the Heat of the beams of the Noon-Sun, raiſed me up with my Dew; and that if I had had Vials enough about me, it would poſſibly have carried me up
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57769:8"/> into the Air in their view. I had a mind to have ſpoken to them; but as if Fear had changed them into Birds, immediately I loſt ſight of them, in an adjoyning Foreſt. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I catched hold of one, whoſe Legs had, without doubt, betrayed his Heart. I asked him, but with a great deal of pain, (for I was quite choked) how far they reckoned from thence to
<hi>Paris?</hi> How long Men had gone naked in <hi>France?</hi> and why they fled from me in ſo great Conſternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? The Man I ſpoke to was an old taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fellow, who preſently fell at my Feet, and with lifted-up Hands, joyned behind his Head, opened his Mouth and ſhut his Eyes: He mumbled a long while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Teeth, but I could not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh an articulate Word; ſo that I took his Language for the maffling noiſe of a Dumb-man.</p>
                  <p>Some time after, I ſaw a Company of Souldiers marching, with Drums beating; and I perceived Two detached from the reſt, to come and take ſpeech of me. When they were come within hearing, I asked them, Where I was? You are in <hi>France,</hi> anſwered they: But what Devil hath put you into that Dreſs? And how comes it that we know you not? Is the Fleet then arrived? Are you going to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the News of it to the Governor?
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57769:9"/> And why have you divided your Brandy into ſo many Bottles? To all this I made anſwer, That the Devil had not put me into that Dreſs: That they knew me not; becauſe they could not know all Men: That I knew nothing of the <hi>Seine's</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Ships to <hi>Paris:</hi> That I had no news for the <hi>Marſhal de l' Hoſpital;</hi> and that I was not loaded with Brandy. Ho, ho, ſaid they to me, taking me by the Arm, you are a merry Fellow indeed; come, the Governor will make a ſhift to know you, no doubt on't. They led me to their Company, where I learnt that I was in reality in <hi>France,</hi> but that it was in <hi>New-France:</hi> So that ſome time after, I was preſented before the Governor, who asked me my Country, my Name and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and after that I had ſatisfied him in all Points, and told him the pleaſant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of my Voyage, whether he believed it, or only pretended to do ſo, he had the goodneſs to order me a Chamber in his Apartment. I was very happy, in meeting with a Man capable of lofty Opinions, and who was not at all ſurpriſed, when I told him, that the Earth muſt needs have turned during my Elevation; ſeeing that having begun to mount about Two Leagues from
<hi>Paris,</hi> I was fallen, as it were, by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular Line in
<hi>Canada.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57769:9"/> When I was going to Bed at night, he came into my Chamber, and ſpoke to me to this purpoſe: I ſhould not have come to diſturb your Reſt, had I not thought that one who hath found out the ſecret, of Travelling ſo far in Twelve hours ſpace, had likewiſe a charm againſt Laſſitude. But you know not, added he, what a pleaſant Quarrel I have juſt now had with our Fathers, upon your account? They'll have you abſolutely to be a Magician; and the greateſt favour you can expect from them, is to be reckoned only an Impoſtor: The truth is, that Motion which you attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Earth, is a pretty nice Paradox; and for my part I'll frankly tell you, That that which hinders me from being of your Opinion, is, That though you parted yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day from <hi>Paris,</hi> yet you might have arrived to day in this Country, without the Earth's turning: For the Sun having drawn you up, by the means of your Bottles, ought he not to have brought you hither; ſince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> and the Modern Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, he marches obliquely, as you make the Earth to move? And beſides, what great Probability have you to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the Sun is immoveable, when we ſee it go? And what appearance is there, that the Earth turns with ſo great Rapidity, when we feel it firm under our Feet? Sir,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57769:10"/> replied I to him, Theſe are, in a manner, the Reaſons that oblige us to think ſo: In the firſt place, it is conſonant to common Senſe, to think that the Sun is placed in the Center of the Univerſe; ſeeing all Bodies in nature, ſtanding in need of that radical Heat, it is fit he ſhould reſide in the heart of the Kingdom, that he may be in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, readily to ſupply the Neceſſities of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Part; and that the Cauſe of Generations, ſhould be placed in the middle of all Bodies, that it may act there with greater Equality and Eaſe: After the ſame manner, as Wiſe Nature hath placed the Genitals in Man, the Seeds in the Center of Apples, the Kernels in the middle of their Fruits; and in the ſame manner, as the Onion, under the cover of ſo many Coats that encompaſs it, preſerves that precious Bud, from which Millions of others are to have their being, for an Apple is in it ſelf a little Univerſe; the Seed, hotter than the other parts thereof, is its Sun, which diffuſes about it ſelf that natural Heat, which preſerves its Globe: And in the Onion, the Germ is the little Sun of that little World, which vivifies and nouriſhes the vegetative Salt of that little maſs. Having laid down this, then, for a ground, I ſay, That the Earth ſtanding in need of the Light, Heat, and Influence of this great Fire, it turns round it, that it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57769:10"/> may receive in all parts alike, that Virtue which keeps it in Being. For it would be as ridiculous to think, that that vaſt lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Body, turned about a point, that it has not the leaſt need of; as to imagine, that when we ſee a roaſted Lark, that the Kitchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire muſt have turned round it. Elſe, were it the part of the Sun to do that drudgery, it would ſeem that the Phyſician ſtood in need of the Patient; that the Strong ſhould yield to the Weak; the Superior ſerve the Inferior; and that the Ship did not ſail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Land, but the Land about the Ship. Now if you cannot eaſily conceive, how ſo ponderous a Body can move; Pray, tell me, are the Stars and Heavens, which, in your Opinion, are ſo ſolid, any way lighter? Beſides, it is not ſo difficult for us, who are aſſured of the Roundneſs of the Earth, to infer its motion from its Figure: But why do ye ſuppoſe the Heaven to be round, ſeeing you cannot know it, and that yet, if it hath not this Figure, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it can move? I object not to you your
<hi>Excentricks</hi> nor <hi>Epicycles,</hi> which you cannot explain but very confuſedly, and which are out of doors in my Syſteme. Let's reflect only on the natural Cauſes of that Motion. To make good your Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, you are forced to have recourſe to Spirits or <hi>Intelligences,</hi> that move and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57769:11"/> your Spheres. But for my part, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbing the repoſe of the ſupreme Being, who, without doubt, hath made Nature entirely perfect, and whoſe Wiſdom ought ſo to have compleated her, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfect in one thing, ſhe ſhould not have been defective in another: I ſay, that the Beams and Influences of the Sun, darting Circularly upon the Earth, make it to turn, as with a turn of the Hand, we make a Globe to move; or, which is much the ſame, that the Steams which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally evaporate from that ſide of it, which the Sun ſhines upon, being reverbera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Cold of the middle Region, rebound upon it, and ſtriking obliquely, do of neceſſity make it whirle about in that manner.</p>
                  <p>The Explication of the other Motions is leſs perplexed ſtill; for pray, conſider a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle— At theſe words the Vice-Roy inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted me: I had rather, ſaid he, you would excuſe your ſelf from that trouble; for I have read ſome Books of <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> on that ſubject: And hear what one of our Fathers, who maintained your Opinion one day, anſwered me. Really, ſaid he, I fancy that the Earth does move, not for the Reaſons alledged by <hi>Copernicus;</hi> but becauſe Hell-fire, being ſhut up in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Earth, the damned who make a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57769:11"/> great buſtle to avoid its Flames, ſcramble up to the Vault, as far as they can from them, and ſo make the Earth to turn, as a Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpit makes the Wheel go round, when he runs about in it.</p>
                  <p>We applauded that Thought, as being a pure effect of the Zeal of that good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And then the Vice-Roy told me, That he much wondered, how the Syſteme of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> being ſo improbable, ſhould have been ſo univerſally received. Sir, ſaid I to him, moſt part of Men, who judge of all things by the Senſes, have ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be perſwaded by their Eyes; and as he who Sails along a Shoar, thinks the Ship immoveable, and the Land in motion; even ſo Men turning with the Earth round the Sun, have thought that it was the Sun that moved about them. To this may be added, the unſupportable Pride of Mankind, who perſwade themſelves, that Nature hath only been made for them; as if it were

                     </gap>anets about them, that's to ſay, Worlds,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57769:12"/> which becauſe of their ſmallneſs, and that their borrowed light cannot reach us, are not diſcernable by Men in this World: For in good earneſt, how can it be imagined, that ſuch ſpacious Globes are no more but vaſt Deſarts; and that ours, becauſe we live in it, hath been framed for the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a dozen of proud Dandyprats? How, muſt it be ſaid, becauſe the Sun meaſures our Days and Years, that it hath only been made, to keep us from running our Heads againſt the Walls? No, no, if that viſible Deity ſhine upon Man, it's by accident, as the King's Flamboy by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent lightens a Porter that walks along the Street: But, ſaid he to me, if, as you affirm, the fixed Stars be ſo many Suns, it will follow, that the World is infinite; ſeeing it is probable, that the People of that World, which moves about that fixed Star, you take for a Sun, diſcover above them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves other fixed Stars, which we cannot perceive from hence, and ſo others in that manner <hi>in infinitum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Never queſtion, replied I, but as God could create the Soul Immortal, He could alſo make the World Infinite; if ſo it be that Eternity is nothing elſe, but an illimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Duration, and an <hi>infinite,</hi> a boundleſs Extenſion: And then God himſelf would be Finite, ſuppoſing the World not to be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57769:12"/> infinite, ſeeing he cannot be where nothing is, and that he could not encreaſe the greatneſs of the World, without adding ſomewhat to his own Being, by beginning to exiſt, where he did not exiſt before. We muſt believe then, that as from hence we ſee <hi>Saturn</hi> and
<hi>Jupiter;</hi> if we were in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Two, we ſhould diſcover a great many Worlds which we perceive not, and that the Univerſe extends ſo
<hi>in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I' faith, replied he, when you have ſaid all you can, I cannot at all compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that Infinitude. Good now, replied I to him, do you comprehend the Nothing that is beyond it? Not at all. For when you think of that <hi>Nothing,</hi> you imagine it at leaſt to be like Wind or Air, and that is a Being: But if you conceive not an <hi>Infinite</hi> in general, you comprehend it at leaſt in particulars; ſeeing it is not difficult to fancy to our ſelves beyond the Earth, Air, and Fire which we ſee, other Air, and other Earth, and other Fire. Now Infinitude is nothing elſe, but a boundleſs Series of all theſe. But if you ask me, How theſe Worlds have been made, ſeeing Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks only of one that God made? My anſwer is, That I have no more to ſay: For to oblige me to give a Reaſon for every thing, that comes into my Imagination, is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57769:13"/> to ſtop my Mouth, and make me confeſs, that in things of that nature, my Reaſon ſhall always ſtoop to Faith. He ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly acknowledged to me, that his Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to be cenſured, but bid me purſue my notion: So that I went on, and told him, That all the other Worlds, which are not ſeen, or but imperfectly believed, are no more, but the Scum that purges out of the Suns. For how could theſe great Fires ſubſiſt without ſome matter, that ſerved them for Fewel? Now as the Fire drives from it the Aſhes that would ſtifle it, or the Gold in a Crucible, ſeparates from the Marcaſite and Droſs, and is refined to the higheſt Standard; nay, and as our Stomack diſcharges it ſelf by vomit, of the Crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that oppreſs it; even ſo theſe Suns dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evacuate, and reject the Remains of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that might incommode their Fire: But when they have wholly conſumed that matter, which entertains them; you are not to doubt, but they ſpread themſelves abroad on all ſides, to ſeek for freſh Fewel, and faſten upon the Worlds, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore they have made, and particularly upon thoſe that are neareſt: Then theſe great Fires, reconcocting all the Bodies, will as formerly force them out again,
<hi>Pell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell</hi> from all parts; and being by little and little purified, they'll begin to ſerve for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57769:13"/> Suns, to other little Worlds, which they procreate by driving them out of their Spheres: And that without doubt, made the
<hi>Pythagoreans</hi> foretel the univerſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration.</p>
                  <p>This is no ridiculous Imagination, for <hi>New-France</hi> where we are, gives us a very convincing inſtance of it. The vaſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of <hi>America,</hi> is one half of the Earth, which in ſpight of our Predeceſſors, who a Thouſand times had cruiſed the Ocean, was not at that time diſcovered: Nor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, was it then in being, no more than a great many Iſlands, Peninſules, and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that have ſince ſtarted up in our Globe; when the Sun purged out its Excrements to a convenient diſtance, and ſufficient Gravity, to be attracted by the Center of our World, either in ſmall Particles, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, or, it may be alſo, altogether in one lump. That is not ſo unreaſonable, but that St. <hi>Austin</hi> would have applauded to it, if that Country had been diſcovered in his Age. Seeing that great Man, who had a very clear Wit, aſſures us, That in his time, the Earth was flat like the floor of an Oven, and that it floated upon the Water, like the half of an Orange: But if ever I have the honour to ſee you in <hi>France,</hi> I'll make you obſerve, by means of a moſt excellent Celeſcope, that ſome Obſcurities,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57769:14"/> which from hence appear to be Spots, are Worlds a forming.</p>
                  <p>My Eyes that ſhut with this Diſcourſe, obliged the Vice-Roy to withdraw. Next Day, and the Days following, we had ſome Diſcourſes to the ſame purpoſe: But ſome time after, ſince the hurry of Affairs ſuſpended our Philoſophy, I fell afreſh upon the deſign of mounting up to the Moon.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as ſhe was up, I walked about muſing in the Woods, how I might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and ſucceed in my Enterpriſe; and at length on St. <hi>John</hi>'s-Eve, when they were at Council in the Fort, whether they ſhould aſſiſt the Wild Natives of the Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt the
<hi>Iroqueans;</hi> I went all alone to the top of a little Hill, at the back of our Habitation, where I put in Practice what you ſhall hear. I had made a Machine, which I fancied might carry me up as high as I pleaſed, ſo that nothing ſeeming to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, I placed my ſelf within, and from the Top of a Rock, threw my ſelf in the Air: But becauſe I had not taken my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures aright, I fell with a ſoſh in the Valley below. Bruiſed as I was, however, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to my Chamber, without looſing courage, and with Beef-Marrow I anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Body, for I was all over mortified from Head to Foot: Then having taken a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57769:14"/> dram of Cordial Waters to ſtrengthen my Heart, I went back to look for my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine; but I could not find it, for ſome Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that had been ſent into the Foreſt, to cut wood for a Bonefire, meeting with it by chance, had carried it with them to the Fort: Where after a great deal of gueſſing what it might be, when they had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the invention of the Spring, ſome ſaid, that a good many Fire-Works ſhould be faſtened to it, becauſe their Force carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up on high, and the Machine play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its large Wings, no Body but would take it for a Fiery Dragon. In the mean time I was long in ſearch of it, but found it at length in the middle of the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of <hi>Kebeck,</hi> juſt as they were ſetting Fire to it. I was ſo tranſported with Grief, to find the Work of my Hands in ſo great Peril, that I ran to the Souldier, that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Fire to it, caught hold of his Arm, pluckt the Match out of his Hand, and in great rage threw my ſelf into my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, that I might undo the Fire-Works, that they had ſtuck about it; but I came too late, for hardly were both my Feet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, when whip, away went I up in a Cloud: The Horror and Conſternation I was in, did not ſo confound the faculties of my Soul, but I have ſince remembred all that happened to me at that inſtant. For ſo ſoon
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57769:15"/> as the Flame had devoured one tire of Squibs, which were ranked by ſix and ſix, by means of a Train, that reached every half-dozen; another tire went off, and then another; ſo that the Salt-Peter taking Fire, put off the danger by encreaſing it. However, all the combuſtible matter being ſpent, there was a period put to the Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work; and whilſt I thought of nothing leſs, than to knock my Head againſt the top of ſome Mountain, I felt, without the leaſt ſtirring, my elevation continuing; and adieu Machine, for I ſaw it fall down again towards the Earth. That extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Adventure puffed up my Heart with ſo uncommon a Gladneſs; that, raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee my ſelf delivered from certain danger, I had the impudence to philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phize upon it. Whilſt then with Eyes and Thought I caſt about, to find what might be the cauſe of it, I perceived my fleſh blown up, and ſtill greaſy with the Marrow, that I had daubed my ſelf over with, for the Bruiſes of my fall: I knew that the Moon being then in the Wain, and that it being uſual for her in that Quarter, to ſuck up the Marrow of Animals; ſhe drank up that wherewith I was anointed, with ſo much the more force, that her Globe was nearer to me, and that no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Clouds weakened her Attraction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:57769:15"/> When I had, according to the computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I made ſince, advanced a good deal more, than three quarters of the ſpace, that divided the Earth from the Moon; all of a ſudden I fell with my Heels up, and Head down, though I had made no Trip; and indeed, I had not been ſenſible of it, had not I felt my Head loaded under the weight of my Body: The truth is, I knew very well, that I was not falling again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our World; for though I found my ſelf to be betwixt two Moons, and eaſily obſerved, that the nearer I drew to the one, the farther I removed from the other; yet I was certain, that ours was the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Globe of the two: Becauſe after one or two days Journey, the remote Refracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Sun, confounding the diverſity of Bodies and Climates, it appeared to me only as a large Plate of Gold: That made me imagine, that I byaſſed towards the Moon; and I was confirmed in that Opinion, when I began to call to mind, that I did not fall, till I was paſt three quarters of the way. For, ſaid I to my ſelf, that Maſs being leſs than ours, the Sphere of its Activity muſt be of leſs Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent alſo; and by conſequence, it was la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before I felt the force of its Center.</p>
                  <p>In fine, after I had been a very long while in falling, as I judged, for the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57769:16"/> of my Precipitation hindered me from obſerving it more exactly: The laſt thing I can remember is, That I found my ſelf under a Tree, entangled with three or four pretty large Branches, which I had broken off by my fall; and my Face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared with an Apple, that had daſhed againſt it.</p>
                  <p>By good luck that place was, as you ſhall know by and by — So that you may very well conclude, that had it not been for that Chance, if I had had a thouſand lives, they had been all loſt. I have many times ſince reflected upon the vulgar Opinion, That if one precipitate himſelf from a very high place, his breath is out before he reach the ground; and from my adventure I conclude it to be falſe, or elſe that the efficacious Juyce of that Fruit, which ſquirted into my mouth, muſt needs have recalled my Soul, that was not far from my Carcaſs, which was ſtill hot, and in a diſpoſition of exerting the Functions of Life. The truth is, ſo foon as I was upon the ground, my pain was gone, before I could think what it was; and the Hunger, which I felt during my Voyage, was fully ſatisfied with the ſenſe that I had loſt it.</p>
                  <p>When I was got up, I had hardly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of the largeſt of Four great
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57769:16"/> Rivers, which by their conflux make a Lake; when the Spirit, or inviſible Soul of Plants, that breath upon that Country, refreſhed my Brain with a delightful ſmell: And I found that the Stones there, were neither hard nor rough; but that they carefully ſoftened themſelves, when one trode upon them. I preſently lighted upon a Walk with five Avenues, in figure like to a Star; the Trees whereof ſeemed to reach up to the Skie, a green plot of lofty Boughs: Caſting up my Eyes from the root to the top, and then making the ſame Survey downwards, I was in doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Earth carried them, or they the Earth, hanging by their Roots: Their high and ſtately Forehead ſeemed alſo to bend, as it were by force, under the weight of the Celeſtial Globes; and one would ſay, that their Sighs and out-ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Arms, wherewith they embraced the Firmament, demanded of the Stars the bounty of their purer Influences, before they had loſt any thing of their Innocence, in the contagious Bed of the Elements. The Flowers there on all hands, without the aid of any other Gardiner but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſend out ſo ſweet (though wild) a Perfume, that it rouzes and delights the Smell: There the incarnate of a Roſe upon the Buſh, and the lively Azure of a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57769:17"/> Violet under the Ruſhes, captivating the Choice, make each of themſelves to be judged the Faireſt: There the whole Year is a Spring; there no poyſonous Plant ſprouts forth, but is as ſoon deſtroyed; there the Brooks by an agreeable murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, relate their Travels to the Pebbles; there Thouſands of Quiriſters make the Woods, reſound with their melodious Notes; and the quavering Clubs of theſe divine Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians are ſo univerſal, that every Leaf of the Foreſt, ſeems to have borrowed the Tongue and ſhape of a Nightingale; nay, and the Nymph <hi>Eccho</hi> is ſo delightful with their Airs, that to hear her repeat, one would ſay, She were ſollicitous to learn them. On the ſides of that Wood, are Two Meadows, whoſe continued Verdure ſeems an Emerauld, reaching out of ſight. The various Colours, which the Spring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon the numerous little Flowers that grow there, ſo delightfully confounds and mingles their Shadows; that it is hard to be known, whether theſe Flowers ſhaken with a gentle Breeze, purſue themſelves, or fly rather from the Careſſes of the Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<hi>Zephyrus;</hi> one would likewiſe take that Meadow for an Ocean, becauſe as the Sea, it preſents no Shoar to the view; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that mine Eye fearing it might loſe it ſelf, having roamed ſo long, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57769:17"/> diſcovered no Coaſt, ſent my Thoughts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently thither; and my Thoughts, imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be the end of the World, were willing to be perſwaded, that ſuch charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places, had, perhaps, forced the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to deſcend, and join the Earth there. In the midſt of that vaſt and pleaſant Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, a ruſtick Fountain bubbles up in Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Purles, crowning its enamelled Banks with Sets of Violets, and multitudes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little Flowers, that ſeem to ſtrive, which ſhall firſt behold it ſelf in that Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal Myrroir: It is as yet in the Cradle, being but newly Born, and its Young and ſmooth Face ſhews not the leaſt Wrinkle. The large Compaſſes it fetches, in circling within it ſelf, demonſtrate its unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to leave its native Soyl: And as if it had been aſhamed to be careſſed in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of its Mother, with a Murmuring it thruſt back my hand, that would have touched it: The Beaſts that came to drink there, more rational than thoſe of our World, ſeemed ſurpriſed to ſee it day upon the Horizon, whilſt the Sun was with the <hi>Antipodes;</hi> and durſt not bend downwards upon the Brink, for fear of falling into the Firmament.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs to you, That at the ſight of ſo many Fine things, I found my ſelf tickled with theſe agreeable Twitches,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57769:18"/> which, they ſay, the <hi>Embryo</hi> feels upon the infuſion of its Soul: My old Hair fell off, and gave place for thicker and ſofter Locks: I perceived my Youth revived, my Face grow ruddy, my natural Heat mingle gently again, with my radical Moiſture: And in a word, I grew younger again, by at leaſt Fourteen Years.</p>
                  <p>I had advanced half a League, through a a Foreſt of Jeſſamines and Myrtles, when I perceived ſomething that ſtirred, lying in the Shade: It was a Youth, whoſe Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Beauty forced me almoſt to Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He ſtarted up to hinder me; crying, It is not to me, but to God that you owe theſe Humilities. You ſee one, anſwered I, ſtunned with ſo many Wonders, that I knew not what to admire moſt; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a World, which without doubt you take for a Moon here, I thought I had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in another, which our Worldlings call a Moon alſo; and behold I am in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice at the Feet of a God, who will not be Adored. Except the quality of a God, replied he, whoſe Creature I only am, the reſt you ſay is true: This Land is the Moon, which you ſee from your Globe, and this place where you are is — Now at that time Man's Imagination was ſo ſtrong, as not being as yet corrupted, neither by Debauches, the Crudity of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57769:18"/> nor the alterations of Diſeaſes, that being excited by a violent deſire of coming to this Sanctuary, and his Body becoming light, through the heat of this Inſpiration; he was carried thither in the ſame manner, as ſome Philoſophers, who having fixed their Imagination, upon the contemplation of a certain Object, have ſprung up in the Air by Raviſhments, which you call Exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. The Woman, who through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of her Sex, was weaker and leſs hot, could not, without doubt, have the Imagination ſtrong enough, to make the Intenſion of her Will, prevail over the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derouſneſs of her Matter; but becauſe there were very few —</p>
                  <p>The Sympathy which ſtill united that half to its whole, drew her towards him as he mounted up, as the Amber attracts the Straw; the Load-ſtone turns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, from whence it hath been taken, and drew to him that part of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as the Sea draws the Rivers which proceed from it. When they arrived in your Earth, they dwelt betwixt <hi>Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> and <hi>Arabia:</hi> Some People knew them by the name of —, and others under that of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> whom the Poets feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have ſtolen Fire from Heaven, by reaſon of his Off-ſpring, who were endowed with a Soul as perfect as his own: So that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57769:19"/> to inhabit your World, that Man left this deſtitute; but the All-wiſe, would not have ſo bleſſed an Habitation, to remain without Inhabitants: He ſuffered a few ages after that — cloyed with the company of Men, whoſe Innocence was corrupted, had a deſire to forſake them. This perſon, however, thought no retreat ſecure enough from the Ambition of Men, who already Murdered one another, about the diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your World; except that bleſſed Land, which his Grand-Father had ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned unto him, and to which no Body had as yet found out the way: But his Imagination ſupplied that; for ſeeing he had obſerved that — he filled Two large Veſſels which he ſealed Hermetically, and faſtened them under his Arm-pits: So ſoon as the Smoak began to riſe upwards, and could not pierce through the Mettal, it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced up the Veſſels on high, and with them alſo that Great Man. When he was got as high as the Moon, and had caſt his Eyes upon that lovely Garden, a fit of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſupernatural Joy convinced him, that that was the place, where his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father had heretofore lived. He quickly untied the Veſſels, which he had girt like Wings about his Shoulders, and did it ſo luckily, that he was ſcarcely Four Fathom in the Air above the Moon, when he ſet
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57769:19"/> his Fins a going; yet het was high enough ſtill, to have been hurt by the fall, had it not been for the large skirts of his Gown, which being ſwelled by the Wind, gently upheld him, till he ſet Foot on ground. As for the two Veſſels, they mounted up to a certain place, where they have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued: And thoſe are they, which now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days you call the
<hi>Balance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt now tell you, the manner how I came hither: I believe you have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got my name, ſeeing it is not long ſince I told it you. You ſhall know then, that I lived on the agreeable Banks of one of the moſt renowned Rivers of your World; where amongſt my Books, I lead a Life pleaſant enough, not to be lamented, though it ſlipt away faſt enough. In the mean while, the more I encreaſed in Knowledge, the more I knew my Ignorance. Our Learned Men never put me in mind of the famous <hi>Mada,</hi> but the thoughts of his perfect Philoſophy made me to Sigh. I was deſpairing of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to attain to it, when one day, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long and profound Studying, I took a piece of Load-ſtone about two Foot ſquare, which I put into a Furnace; and then after it was well purged, precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diſſolved, I drew the calcined At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive of it, and reduced it into the ſize of about an ordinary Bowl.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:57769:20"/> After theſe Preparations, I got a very light Machine of Iron made, into which I went — and when I was well ſeated in my place, I threw this Magnetick Bowl, as high as I could, up into the Air. Now the Iron Machine, which I had purpoſely made more maſſive in the middle than at the ends, was preſently elevated, and in a juſt Poiſe; becauſe the middle received the greateſt force of Attraction. So then, as I arrived at the place, whither my Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone had attracted me, I preſently threw up my Bowl in the Air over me. But, ſaid I, interrupting him, How came you to heave up your Bowl ſo ſtreight over your Chariot, that it never happened to be on one ſide of it? That ſeems to me to be no wonder at all, ſaid he; for the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone being once thrown up in the Air, drew the Iron ſtreight towards it; and ſo it was impoſſible, that ever I ſhould mount ſide-ways. Nay more, I can tell you, that when I held the Bowl in my hand, I was ſtill mounting upwards; becauſe the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot flew always to the Load-ſtone, which I held over it. But the effort of the Iron, to be united to my Bowl, was ſo violent, that it made my Body bend double; ſo that I durſt but once eſſay that new Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment. The truth is, it was a very ſurprizing Spectacle to behold; for the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57769:20"/> Steel of that flying Houſe, which I had very carefully Poliſhed, reflected on all ſides the light of the Sun, with ſo great life and luſtre, that I thought my ſelf to be all on fire. In fine, after often Bowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and following of my Caſt, I came, as you did, to an Elevation, from which I deſcended towards this World; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at that inſtant, I held my Bowl ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faſt between my hands, my Machine, whereof the Seat preſſed me hard, that it might approach its Atractive, did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me; all that now I feared was, that I ſhould break my Neck: But to ſave me from that, ever now and then, I toſſed up my Bowl; that by its atractive Virtue, it might prevent the violent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of my Machine, and render my fall more eaſie, as indeed it happened; for when I ſaw my ſelf, within Two or three hundred fathom of the Earth, I threw out my Bowl on all hands, level with the Chariot, ſometimes on this ſide, and ſometimes on that, until I came to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Diſtance; and immediately then, I toſſed it up above me; ſo that my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine following it, I left it, and let my ſelf ſall on the other ſide, as gently as I could, upon the Sand; inſomuch that my fall was no greater, than if it had been but my own height. I ſhall not deſcribe to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57769:21"/> you the amazement I was in at the ſight of the wonders of this place, ſeeing it was ſo like the ſame, wherewith I juſt now ſaw you ſeized—</p>
                  <p>Scarcely had I taſted it, when a thick Cloud over-caſt my Soul: I ſaw no body now near me; and in the whole Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, my Eyes could not diſcern the leaſt Tract of the way I had made; yet, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs I fully remembred every thing that befel me. When I reflected ſince upon that Miracle, I fanced that the skin of the Fruit which I bit, had not rendered me altogether brutiſh; becauſe my Teeth piercing through it were, a little moiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Juyce within, the efficacy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of had diſſipated the Malignities of the Rind. I was not a little ſurpriſed to ſee my ſelf all alone, in a Country I knew not. It was to no purpoſe for me, to ſtare and look about me; for no Creature ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to comfort me: At length, I reſolved to march forwards, till Fortune ſhould aford me the company of ſome Beaſts, or at leaſt the means of Dying.</p>
                  <p>She favourably granted my deſire; for within half a quarter of a League, I met two huge Animals, one of which ſtopt before me, and the other fled ſwiftly to its Den; for ſo I thought at leaſt; becauſe that ſome time after, I perceived it come back again,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57769:21"/> in company of above Seven or Eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the ſame kind, who beſet me. When I could diſcern them at a near di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I perceived that they were propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned and ſhaped like us. This adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture brought into my mind, the old Wives Tales of my Nurſe concerning <hi>Syrenes, Faunes</hi> and <hi>Satyrs:</hi> Ever now and then they raiſed ſuch furious Shouts, occaſioned undoubtedly by their Admiration, at the ſight of me, that I thought I was e'en turned a Monſter. At length one of theſe Beaſt-like men, catching hold of me by the Neck, juſt as Wolves do when they carry away Sheep, toſſed me upon his back, and brought me into their Town; where I was more amazed than before, when I knew they were Men, that I could meet with none of them, but who marched upon all four.</p>
                  <p>When theſe People ſaw that I was ſo little, (for moſt of them are Twelve Cubits long,) and that I walked only upon Two Legs, they could not believe me to be a Man: For they were of opinion, that Nature having given to men as well as Beaſts Two Legs and Two Arms, they ſhould both make uſe of them alike. And, indeed, reflecting upon that ſince, that ſcituation of Body did not ſeem to me altogether extravagant; when I called to mind, that whilſt Children are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57769:22"/> ſtill under the nurture of Nature, they go upon all four, and that they riſe not on their two Legs, but by the care of their Nurſes; who ſet them in little running Chairs, and faſten ſtraps to them, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from falling on all four, as the only poſture that the ſhape of our Body naturally inclines to reſt in.</p>
                  <p>They ſaid then, (as I had it interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me ſince) That I was infallibly the Female of the Queens little Animal. And therefore as ſuch, or ſomewhat elſe, I was carried ſtreight to the Town-Houſe, where I obſerved by the muttering and geſtures, both of the People and Magiſtrates, that they were conſulting what ſort of a thing I could be. When they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred together a long while, a certain Burgher, who had the keeping of the ſtrange Beaſts, beſought the Mayor and Aldermen to commit me to his Cuſtody, till the Queen ſhould ſend for me to couple me to my Male. This was granted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difficulty, and that Juggler carried me to his Houſe; where he taught me to Tumble, Vault, make Mouths, and ſhew a Hundred odd Tricks, for which in the Afternoons he received Money at the door, from thoſe that came in to ſee me: But Heaven pitying my Sorrows, and vext to ſee the Temple of its Maker profaned, ſo
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57769:22"/> ordered it, that one day as I was tied to a Rope, wherewith the Mountebank made me Leap and Skip to divert the People; I heard a Man's voice, who asked me what I was, in Greek. I was much ſurpriſed to hear one ſpeak in that Country, as they do in our World. He put ſome Queſtions to me, which I anſwered, and then gave him a full account of my whole deſign, and the ſucceſs of my Travels: He took the pains to comfort me, and, as I take it, ſaid to me: Well, Son, at length you ſuffer for the frailties of your World: There is a Mobile here, as well as there, that can away with nothing, but what they are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to: But know, that you are but juſtly ſerved; for had any one of this Earth, had the boldneſs to mount up to yours, and call himſelf a Man, your Sages would have deſtroyed him as a Monſter. He then told me, That he would acquaint the Court with my diſaſter; adding, that ſo ſoon as he had heard the news that went of me, he came to ſee me, and was ſatisfied that I was a man of the World, of which I ſaid I was; becauſe he had Travelled there formerly, and ſojourned in <hi>Greece,</hi> where he was called the <hi>Demon</hi> of
<hi>Socrates:</hi> That after the Death of that Philoſopher, he had governed and taught <hi>Epaminondas</hi> at <hi>Thebes:</hi> After which being gone over to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Juſtice
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57769:23"/> had obliged him to eſpouſe the party of the Younger
<hi>Cato:</hi> That after his Death, he had addicted himſelf to
<hi>Brutus:</hi> That all theſe great Men, having left in that World no more, but the ſhadow of their Virtues, he with his Companions, had retreated to Temples and Solitudes. In a word, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he, the People of your World became ſo dull and ſtupid, that my Companions and I loſt all the Pleaſure, that formerly we had had in inſtructing them: Not but that you have heard Men talk of us; for they called us <hi>Oracles, Nymphs, Geniuſes, Fairies, Houſhold-Gods, Lemmes, Larves, Lamiers, Hobgoblins, Nayades, Incubuſſes, Shades, Manes, Viſions</hi> and <hi>Apparitions:</hi> We aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned your World, in the Reign of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> not long after I had appeared to
<hi>Druſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Livia,</hi> who waged War in <hi>Germany,</hi> whom I forbid to proceed any farther. It is not long ſince I came from thence a ſecond time; within theſe Hundred Years I had a Commiſſion to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel thither: I roamed a great deal in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and converſed with ſome, whom poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly you may have known. One Day, amongſt others, I appeared to <hi>Cardan,</hi> as he was at his Study; I taught him a great many things, and he in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment promiſed me, to inform Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of whom he had thoſe Wonders,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57769:23"/> which he intended to leave in writing. There I ſaw
<hi>Agrippa,</hi> the Abbot <hi>Trithemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> Doctor <hi>Fauſtus, La Broſſe, Caeſar,</hi> and a certain Cabal of Young Men, who are commonly called <hi>Roſacrucians</hi> or <hi>Knights of the Red-Croſs,</hi> whom I taught a great many Knacks and Secrets of Nature, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, have made them paſs for great Magicians: I knew <hi>Campanella</hi> alſo; it was I that adviſed him, whilſt he was in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition at <hi>Rome,</hi> to put his Face and Body into the uſual Poſtures of thoſe, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide he needed to know, that by the ſame frame of Body, he might excite in himſelf, the thoughts which the ſame ſcituation had raiſed in his Adverſaries; becauſe by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he might better manage their Soul, when he came to know it; and at my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he began a Book, which we Entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>De Senſu Rerum.</hi> I likewiſe haunted in <hi>France, La Mothe le Vayer</hi> and <hi>Gaſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus;</hi> this laſt hath written as much like a Philoſopher, as the other lived: I have known a great many more there, whom your Age call <hi>Divines,</hi> but all that I could find in them, was a great deal of Babble, and a great deal of Pride. In fine, ſince I paſt over from your Country into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> to acquaint my ſelf, with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of its Inhabitants, I met with a Man, the ſhame of his Country; for certainly it
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57769:24"/> is a great ſhame for the Grandees of your States, to know the virtue which in him has its Throne, and not to adore him: That I may give you an Abridgement of his Panegyrick, he is all Wit, all Heart, and poſſeſſes all the Qualities, of which one alone was heretofore ſufficient to make an Heroe: It was <hi>Triſtan</hi> the Hermite. The Truth is, I muſt tell you, when I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo exalted a Virtue, I miſtruſted it would not be taken notice of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I endeavoured to make him accept Three Vials, the firſt filled with the Oyl of Talk, the other with the Powder of Projection, and the third with <hi>Aurum Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile;</hi> but he refuſed them with a more generous Diſdain, than <hi>Diogenes</hi> did the Complements of <hi>Alexander.</hi> In fine, I can add nothing to the Elogy of that Great Man, but that he is the only Poet, the only Philoſopher, and the only Free-man amongſt you: Theſe are the conſiderable Perſons that I converſed with; all the reſt, at leaſt, that I know, are ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Men, that I have ſeen Beaſts ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above them.</p>
                  <p>After all, I am not a Native neither of this Country nor yours, I was born in the Sun; but becauſe ſometimes our World is over-ſtock'd with people, by reaſon of the long Lives of the Inhabitants, and that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57769:24"/> there is hardly any Wars, or Diſeaſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them: Our Magiſtrates, from time to time, ſend Colonies into the neigbouring Worlds. For my own part, I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to go to yours; being declared Chief of the Colony that accompanyed me. I came ſince into this World, for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I told you; and that which makes me continue here, is, becauſe the Men are great lovers of Truth, have no Pedants among them; that the Philoſophers are never perſwaded but by Reaſon, and that the Authority of a Doctor, or of a great number, is not preferred before the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a Threſher in a Barn, when he has right on his ſide. In ſhort, none are reckoned Mad-men in this Country, but Sophiſters and Orators. I asked him how they lived? he made anſwer, three or four thouſand Years; and thus went on:</p>
                  <p>Though the Inhabitants of the Sun, be not ſo numerous as thoſe of this World; yet the Sun is many times over ſtocked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the People being of a hot conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are ſtirring and ambitious, and digeſt much.</p>
                  <p>You ought not to be ſurpriſed at what I tell you; for though our Globe be very vaſt, and yours little, though we die not before the end of Four thouſand Years, and you at the end of Fifty; yet know, that as there
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57769:25"/> are not ſo many Stones as clods of Earth, nor ſo many Animals as Plants, nor ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men as Beaſts; juſt ſo there ought not to be ſo many Spirits as Men, by reaſon of the difficulties that occur in the Generation of a perfect Creature.</p>
                  <p>I asked him, if they were Bodies as we are? He made anſwer, That they were Bodies, but not like us, nor any thing elſe which we judged ſuch; becauſe we call nothing a Body commonly, but what we can touch: That, in ſhort, there was nothing in Nature, but what was material; and that though they themſelves were ſo, yet they were forced, when they had a mind to appear to us, to take Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies proportionated to what our Senſes are able to know; and that, without doubt, that was the reaſon, why many have taken the Stories that are told of them, for the Deluſions of a weak Fancy, becauſe they only appeared in the night time: He told me withal, That ſeeing they were neceſſitated to piece together the Bodies, they were to make uſe of in great haſte, many times they had not leiſure enough, to render them the Objects of more Senſes than one at a time, ſometimes of the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the Voices of <hi>Oracles,</hi> ſometimes of the Sight,, as the
<hi>Fires</hi> and <hi>Viſions,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the Feeling, as the
<hi>Incubuſſes;</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:57769:25"/> and that theſe Bodies being but Air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed, in ſuch or ſuch a manner, the Light diſperſed them by its heat, in the ſame manner, as it ſcatters a Miſt.</p>
                  <p>So many fine things as he told me, gave me the curioſity to queſtion him about his Birth and Death; if in the Country of the Sun, the
<hi>individual</hi> was procreated by the ways of Generation, and if it died by the diſſolution of its Conſtitution, or the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure of its Organs? Your ſenſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, bear but too little proportion to the Explication of theſe Myſteries: Ye Gentlemen imagine, that whatſoever you cannot comprehend is ſpiritual, or that it is not at all; but that Conſequence is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and it is an argument, that there are a Million of things, perhaps, in the Univerſe, that would require a Million of different Organs in you, to underſtand them. For inſtance, I by my Senſes know the cauſe of the Sympathy, that is betwixt the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and the Pole, of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, and what becomes of the Animal after Death; you cannot reach theſe high Conceptions but by Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Secrets above the power of your Intellects; no more than a Blind-man can judge of the beauties of a Land-skip, the Colours of a Picture, or the ſtreaks of a Rain-bow; or at beſt he will fancy them
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57769:26"/> to beſomewhat palpable, to be like Eating, a Sound, or a pleaſant Smell: Even ſo, ſhould I attempt to explain to you, what I perceive by the Senſes which you want, you would repreſent it to your ſelf, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that may be Heard, Seen, Felt, Smelt or Taſted, and yet it is no ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>He was gone on ſo far in his Diſcourſe, when my Juggler perceived, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany began to be weary of my Gibberiſh, that they underſtood not, and which they took to be an inarticulated Grunting: He therefore fell to pulling my Rope afreſh, to make me leap and skip, till the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors having had their Belly-fulls of Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, affirmed that I had almoſt as much Wit, as the Beaſts of their Country, and ſo broke up.</p>
                  <p>Thus, all the comfort I had during the miſery of my hard Uſage, were the viſits of this officious Spirit; for you may judge what converſation I could have, with theſe that came to ſee me, ſince beſides that they only took me for an Animal, in the higheſt claſs of the
<hi>Category</hi> of Bruits, I neither underſtood their Language, nor they mine. For you muſt know, that there are but two Idioms in uſe in that Country, one for the Grandees, and another for the People in general.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:57769:26"/> That of the great ones is no more, but various inarticulate Tones, much like to our Muſick, when the Words are not added to the Air: and in reality it is an Invention, both very uſeful and pleaſant; for when they are weary of talking, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to proſtitute their Throats to that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, they take either a Lute, or ſome other Inſtrument, whereby they communicate their Thoughts, as well as by their Tongue: So that ſometimes Fifteen or Twenty in a Company, will handle a point of Divinity, or diſcuſs the difficulties of a Law-ſuit, in the moſt harmonious Conſort, that ever tickled the Ear.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, which is uſed by the Vulgar, is performed by a ſhivering of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but not, perhaps, as you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, for ſome parts of the Body ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie an entire Diſcourſe; for example, the agitation of a Finger, a Hand, an Ear, a Lip, an Arm, an Eye, a Cheek, every one ſeverally will make up an Oration, or a Period with all the parts of it: Others ſerve only inſtead of Words, as the knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Brows, the ſeveral quiverings of the Muſcles, the turning of the Hands, the ſtamping of the Feet, the contorſion of the Arm; ſo that when they ſpeak, as their Cuſtom is, ſtark naked, their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers being uſed to geſticulate their Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57769:27"/> move ſo quick, that one would not think it to be a Man that ſpoke, but a Body that trembled.</p>
                  <p>Every day almoſt the Spirit came to ſee me, and his rare Converſation made me patiently bear with the rigour of my Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. At length, one morning I ſaw a Man enter my Cabbin, whom I knew not, who having a long while licked me gently, took me up in his Teeth by the Shoulder, and with one of his Paws, wherewith he held me up, for fear I might hurt my ſelf, threw me upon his Back; where I found my ſelf ſo ſoftly ſeated, and ſo much at my eaſe, that being afflicted to be uſed like a Beaſt, I had not the leaſt deſire of making my eſcape; and beſides, theſe Men that go upon all four, are much ſwifter than we, ſeeing the heavieſt of them, make nothing of running down a Stagg.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time I was extreamly troubled, that I had no news of my cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Spirit; and the firſt night we came to our Inn, as I was walking in the Court, expecting till Supper ſhould be ready, a pretty handſome young Man came ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my Face, and caſt his Two Fore-Legs about my Neck. After I had a little conſidered him: How! ſaid he in
<hi>French,</hi> do not you know your Friend then? I leave you to judge in what
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57769:181"/> caſe I was at that time; really, my ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe was ſo great, that I began to imagine, that all the Globe of the Moon, all that had befallen me, and all that I had ſeen, had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been Enchantment: And that Beaſt-man, who was the ſame that had carried me all day, continued to ſpeak to me in this manner; You promiſed me, that the good Offices I did you, ſhould never be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and yet it ſeems you have never ſeen me before; but perceiving me ſtill in amaze: In fine, ſaid he, I am that ſame <hi>Demon</hi> of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who diverted you during your Impriſonment, and who, that I may ſtill oblige you, took to my ſelf a Body, on which I carried you to day: But, ſaid I interrupting him, how can that be, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all Day you were of a very long Stature, and now you are very ſhort; that all day long you had a weak and broken Voice, and now you have a clear and vigorous one; that, in ſhort, all day long you were a Grey-headed old Man, and are now a briſk young Blade: Is it then that whereas in my Country, the Progreſs is from Life to Death; Animals here go Retrograde from Death to Life, and by growing old become young a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as I had ſpoken to the Prince, ſaid he, and received orders to bring you
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57769:182"/> to Court, I went and found you out where you were, and have brought you hither; but the Body I acted in, was ſo tired out with the Journey, that all its Organs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed me their ordinary Functions, ſo that I enquired the way to the Hoſpital; where being come in I found the Body of a young Man, juſt then expired by a very odd Accident, but yet very common in this Country — I drew near him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to find motion in him ſtill, and proteſting to thoſe who were preſent, that he was not dead, and that what they thought to be the cauſe of his Death, was no more but a bare Lethargy; ſo that without being perceived, I put my Mouth to his, by which I entred as with a breath: Then down dropt my old Carcaſs, and as if I had been that young Man, I roſe and came to look for you, leaving the Spectators crying a Miracle. With this they came to call us to Supper, and I followed my Guide into a Parlour rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed; but where I found nothing fit to be eaten. No Victuals appearing, when I was ready to die of Hunger, made me ask him where the Cloath was laid: But I could not hear what he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, for at that inſtant Three or Four young Boys, Children of the Houſe, drew near, and with much Civility ſtript
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57769:182"/> me to the Shirt. This new Ceremony ſo aſtoniſhed me, that I durſt not ſo much as ask my pretty <hi>Valets de Chamber</hi> the cauſe of it; and I cannot tell how my Guide, who asked me what I would begin with, could draw from me theſe two Words, <hi>A Potage;</hi> but hardly had I pronounced them, when I ſmelt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the moſt agreable Soop, that ever ſteamed in the rich Gluttons Noſe: I was about to riſe from my place, that I might trace that delicious Scent to its ſource, but my Carrier hindered me: Whither are you going, ſaid he, we ſhall fetch a walk by and by; but now it is time to Eat, make an end of your <hi>Potage,</hi> and then we'll have ſomething elſe: And where the Devil is the <hi>Potage?</hi> anſwered I half angry: Have you laid a wager you'll jeer me all this Day? I thought, replied he, that at the Town we came from, you had ſeen your Maſter or ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elſe at meal, and that's the reaſon I told you not, how People feed in this Country. Seeing then you are ſtill ignorant, you muſt know, that here they live on Steams. The art of Cookery is to ſhut up in great Veſſels, made on purpoſe, the Exhalations that proceed from the meat, whilſt it is a dreſſing; and when they have provided enough of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57769:183"/> ſeveral ſorts, and ſeveral taſtes, according to the Appetite of thoſe they treat; they open one Veſſel where that Steam is kept, and after that another; and ſo on till all the Company be ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>Unleſs you have already lived after this manner, you would never think, that the Noſe without Teeth and Gullet, can perform the office of the Mouth, in feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Man; but I'll make you experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it your ſelf. He had no ſooner ſaid ſo, but I found ſo many agreable and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Vapours enter the Parlour, one after another, that in leſs than half a quarter of an Hour I was fully ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When we were got up; This is not a matter, ſaid he, much to be admired at, ſeeing you cannot have lived ſo long, and not have obſerved, that all ſorts of Cooks, who eat leſs than People of another Calling, are nevertheleſs much Fatter. Whence proceeds that Plumpneſs, d'ye think, unleſs it be from the Steams that continually environ them, which pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into their Bodies, and fatten them? Hence it is, that the People of this World enjoy a more ſteady and vigorous Health, by reaſon that their Food hardly engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders any Excrements, which are in a manner the original of all Diseases. You were, perhaps, ſurpriſed, that before ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57769:183"/> you were ſtript, ſince it is a Custom not practiſed in your Country; but it is the faſhion of this, and for this end uſed, that the Animal may be the more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirable to the Fumes. Sir, anſwered I, there is a great deal of probability in what you ſay, and I have found ſomewhat of it my ſelf by experience; but I muſt frankly tell you, That not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to Unbrute my ſelf ſo ſoon, I ſhould be glad to feel ſomething, that my Teeth might fix upon: He promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I ſhould, but not before next Day; becauſe, ſaid he, to Eat ſo ſoon after your meal, would breed Crudities. After we had diſcourſed a little longer, we went up to a Chamber to take our reſt; a Man met us on the top of the Stairs; who having attentively Eyed us, led me into a Cloſet, where the floor was ſtrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Orange-Flowers Three Foot thick, and my Spririt into another, filled with Gilly-Flowers and Jeſſamine: Perceiving me amazed at that Magnificence, he told me, they were the Beds of the Country. In fine, we laid our ſelves down to reſt, in our ſeveral Cells, and ſo ſoon as I had ſtretched my ſelf out upon my Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, by the light of Thirty large Glow-worms ſhut up in a Chrystal, (being the only Candles <hi>Charon</hi> uſes,) I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57769:184"/> the Three or Four Boys, who had ſtript me before Supper, One tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling my Feet, another my Thighs, the Third my Flanks, and the Fourth my Arms, and all ſo delicately and daintily, that in leſs than a Minute I was faſt aſleep.</p>
                  <p>Next Morning by Sun-riſing, my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit came into my Room, and ſaid to me, Now I'll be as good as my Word, you ſhall breakfaſt this Morning, more ſolidly than you Supped laſt Night. With that I got up, and he led me by the Hand to a place, at the back of the Garden, where one of the Children of the Houſe ſtayed for us, with a Piece in his Hand, much like to one of our Fire-Locks. He asked my Guide, if I would have a dozen of Larks, becauſe <hi>Baboons</hi> (one of which he took me to be,) loved to feed on them? I had hardly anſwered, Yes, when the Fowler diſcharged a Shot, and Twenty or Thirty Larks fell at our Feet ready Roaſted. This, thought I preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with my ſelf, verifies the Proverb in our World, of a Country where Larks fall ready Roaſted; without doubt, it has been made by ſome Body that came from hence. Fall too, fall too, ſaid my Spirit, don't ſpare; for they have a knack of ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a certain Compoſition with their
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57769:27"/> Powder and Shot, which Kills, Plucks, Roaſts, and Seaſons the Fowl all at once. I took up ſome of them, and eat them upon his word; and to ſay the Truth, In all my Life time, I never eat any thing ſo delicious. Having thus Breakfaſted, we prepared to be gone, and with a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand odd Faces, which they uſe when they would ſhew their Love; our Landlord received a Paper from my Spirit. I ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, if it was a Note for the Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? He replied, No, that all was paid, and that it was a Copy of Verſes. How! Verſes, ſaid I, are your Inn-Keepers here curious of Rhime then? It's, ſaid he, the Money of the Country, and the charge we have been at here, hath been computed to amount to Three <hi>Coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,</hi> or Six Verſes, which I have given him. I did not fear we ſhould out-run the Conſtable; for though we ſhould Pamper our ſelves for a whole Week; we could not ſpend a <hi>Sonnet,</hi> and I have Four about me, beſides Two
<hi>Epigrams,</hi> Two <hi>Odes,</hi> and an <hi>Eclogue.</hi> Would to God, ſaid I, it were ſo in our World; for I know a good many honeſt Poets there, who are ready to Starve, and who might live plentifully, if that Money would paſs in Payment. I farther asked him, If theſe Verſes would always ſerve,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57769:28"/> if one Tranſcribed them? He made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, No, and ſo went on. When an Author has Compoſed any; he carries them to the Mint, where the ſworn Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets of the Kingdom ſit in Court. There theſe verſifying Officers eſſay the pieces; and if they be judged Sterling, they are rated not according to their Coyn; that's to ſay, That a <hi>Sonnet</hi> is not always as good as a <hi>Sonnet;</hi> but according to the intrinſick value of the piece; ſo that if any one Starve, he muſt be a Blockhead: For Men of Wit make always good Chear. With Extaſie, I was admiring the judicious Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of that Country, when he proceeded in this manner: There are others who keep Publick-houſe, after a far different manner: When one is about to be gone, they demand proportionably to the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, an Acquittance for the other World; and when that is given them, they write down in a great Regiſter, which they call <hi>Doomſday's Book,</hi> much after this manner.
<hi>Item,</hi> The value of ſo many Verſes, delivered ſuch a Day, to ſuch a Perſon, which he is to pay upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of this Acquittance, out of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt Caſh: And when they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in danger of Death, they cauſe theſe Regiſters to be Chopt in pieces, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them down; becauſe they believe,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57769:28"/> that if they were not thus digeſted, they would be good for nothing.</p>
                  <p>This Converſation was no hinderance to our Journey; for my Four-legged Porter jogged on under me, and I rid ſtradling on his Back. I ſhall not be particular in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to you, all the Adventures, that happened to us on our way, till we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at length at the Town, where the King holds his Reſidence. I was no ſooner come, but they carryed me to the Palace, where the Grandees received me with more Moderation, than the People had done, as I paſſed the Streets: But both great and ſmall concluded, That, without doubt, I was the Female of the Queen's little Animal. My Guide was my Interpreter; and yet he himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not the Riddle, and knew not what to make of that little Animal of the Queen's; but we were ſoon ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as to that; for the King having ſome time conſidered me, ordered it to be brought, and about half an hour after, I ſaw a company of Apes, wearing Ruffs and Breeches, come in, and amongſt them a little Man, almoſt of my own Built, for he went on Two Legs; ſo ſoon as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me, he Accoſted me with a <hi>Cria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do de vueſtra merced.</hi> I anſwered his Greeting, much in the ſame Terms. But
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57769:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> alas! no ſooner had they ſeen us talk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but they believed their Conjecture to be true; and ſo, indeed, it ſeemed; for he of all the By-ſtanders, that paſt the moſt favourable Judgment upon us, proteſted, that our Converſation, was a Chattering we kept for Joy at our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again. That little Man told me, that he was an <hi>European,</hi> a Native of old <hi>Caſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le:</hi> That he had found a means by the help of Birds, to mount up to the World of the Moon, where then we were: That falling into the Queen's Hands, ſhe had taken him for a Monkey, becauſe Fate would have it ſo: That in that Country they cloath Apes in a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dreſs; and that upon his arrival, being found in that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, ſhe had made no doubt, but he was of the ſame kind. It could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be, replied I, but having tried all Faſhions of Apparel upon them, none were found ſo Ridiculous, and by conſequence more becoming a kind of Animals, which are only entertained for Pleaſure and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. That ſhews you little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Dignity of our Nation, anſwered he, for whom the Univerſe breeds Men, only to be our Slaves, and Nature produces nothing but objects of Mirth and Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He then intreated me to tell him, how I durſt be ſo bold, as to Scale the Moon
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57769:29"/> with the Machine I told him of? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That it was becauſe he had carried a way the Birds, which I intended to have made uſe of. He ſmiled at this Raillery; and about a quarter of an hour after, the King commanded the Keeper of the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys to carry us back, with expreſs Orders to make the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and me lie together, that we might procreate a breed of Apes in his Kingdom. The King's Pleaſure was punctually obeyed; at which I was very glad, for the ſatisfaction I had, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Mate to converſe with, during the ſolitude of my Brutification. One Day my Male (for I was taken for the Female) told me, That the true reaſon, which had obliged him to travel all over the Earth, and at length to abandon it for the Moon, was, that he could not find ſo much as one Country, where even Imagination was at liberty. Look ye, ſaid he, how the Wittieſt thing you can ſay, unleſs you wear a Cornered Cap, if it thwart the Principles of the Doctors of the Robe, you are an Ideot, a Fool, and ſomething worſe, perhaps. I was about to have been put into the Inquiſition at home, for maintaining to the Pedants Teeth, That there was a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> and that I knew no one matter in the World, more Ponderous than another. I asked him, what probable
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57769:30"/> Arguments he had, to confirm ſo new an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion? To evince that, anſwered he, you muſt ſuppoſe that there is but one Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for though we ſee Water, Earth, Air and Fire diſtinct, yet are they never found to be ſo perfectly pure, but that there ſtill remains ſome Mixture. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, When you behold Fire, it is not Fire but Air much extended; the Air is but Water much dilated; Water is but liquified Earth, and the Earth it ſelf, but condenſed Water; and thus if you weigh Matter ſeriouſly, you'll find it is but one, which like an excellent Comedian here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low acts all Parts, in all ſorts of Dreſſes: Otherwiſe we muſt admit as many Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as there are kinds of Bodies: And if you ask me why Fire burns, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cools, ſince it is but one and the ſame matter, I anſwer, That that matter acts by Sympathy, according to the Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is in, at the time when it acts. Fire which is nothing but Earth alſo, more dilated than is fit for the conſtitution of Air, ſtrives to change into it ſelf, by Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, what ever it meets with: Thus the heat of Coals, being the moſt ſubtile Fire, and moſt proper to penetrate a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, at firſt ſlides through the pores of our Skin; and becauſe it is a new matter that fills us, it makes us exhale in Sweat;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57769:30"/> that Sweat dilated by the Fire is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Steam, and becomes Air; that Air being farther rarified by the heat of the
<hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> or of the Neighbouring Stars, is called Fire, and the Earth abandoned by the Cold and Humidity, which were Ligaments to the whole, falls to the ground: Water, on the other hand, though it no ways differ from the matter of Fire, but in that it is cloſer, burns us not; becauſe that being denſe by Sympathy, it cloſes up the Bodies it meets with, and the Cold we feel is no more, but the effect of our Fleſh contracting it ſelf, becauſe of the Vicinity of Earth or Water, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains it toa Reſemblance. Hence it is, that thoſe who are troubled with a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, convert all their nouriſhment into Water; and the Cholerick convert all the Blood, that is formed in their Liver, into Choler. It being then ſuppoſed, that there is but one Element; it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that all Bodies, according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral qualities, incline equally towards the Center of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>But you'll ask me, Why then does Iron, Metal, Earth and Wood, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend more ſwiftly to the Center than a Sponge, if it be not that it is full of Air, which naturally tends upwards? That is not at all the Reaſon, and thus I
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57769:31"/> make it out: Though a Rock fall with greater Rapidity than a Feather, both of them have the ſame inclination for the Journey; but a Cannon Bullet, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, where the Earth pierced through, would precipitate with greater haſte to the Center thereof, than a Bladder full of Wind; and the reaſon is, becauſe that maſs of Metal, is a great deal of Earth contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a little ſpace, and that Wind a very little Earth in a large ſpace: For all the parts of Matter, being ſo cloſely joined together in the Iron, encreaſe their force by their Union; becauſe being thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted, they are many that Fight againſt a few, ſeeing a parcel of Air equal to the Bullet in Bigneſs, is not equal in Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</p>
                  <p>Not to inſiſt on a long Deduction of Arguments to prove this, tell me in good earneſt, How a Pike, a Sword or a Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wound us? If it be not, becauſe the Steel, being a matter, wherein the parts are more continuous, and more cloſely knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, than your Fleſh is, whoſe Pores and Softneſs ſhew, that it contains but very little Matter, within a great extent of Place; and that the point of the Steel that pricks us, being almoſt an innumerable number of Particles of matter, againſt a very little Fleſh, it forces it to yeild to the ſtronger,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57769:31"/> in the ſame manner as a Squadron in cloſe order, will eaſily break through a more open Battallion; for why does a Bit of red hot Iron, burn more than a Log of Wood all on Fire? Unleſs it be, that in the Iron, there is more Fire in a ſmall ſpace, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it adheres, to all the parts of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, than in the Wood which being very Spongy, by conſequence contains a great deal of <hi>Vacuity;</hi> and that <hi>Vacuity,</hi> being but a Privation of Being, cannot receive the form of Fire. But, you'll object, you ſuppoſe a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> as if you had proved it, and that's begging of the queſtion: Well then I'll prove it, and though that diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty be the Siſter of the <hi>Gordian knot,</hi> yet my Arms are ſtrong enough to become its <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let that vulgar Beaſt, then, who does not think it ſelf a Man, had it not been told ſo, anſwer me if it can: Suppoſe now there be but one Matter, as I think I have ſufficiently peoved; whence comes it, that according to its Appetite, it enlarges or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts its ſelf; whence is it, that a piece of Earth, by being Condenſed becomes a Stone? Is it that the parts of that Stone are placed one with another, in ſuch a manner, that wherever that grain of Sand is ſettled, even there, or in the ſame point, another grain of Sand is Lodged? That
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57769:32"/> cannot be, no not according to their own Principles, ſeeing there is no Penetration of Bodies: But that matter muſt have crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and if you will, abridged it ſelf, ſo that it hath filled ſome place which was empty before. To ſay, that it is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, that there ſhould be a Nothing in the World, that we are in part made up of Nothing: Why not, pray? Is not the whold World wrapt up in Nothing? Since you yield me this point, then confeſs ingeniouſly, that it's as rational, that the World ſhould have a Nothing within it, as Nothing about it.</p>
                  <p>I well perceive you'll put the queſtion to me, Why Water compreſſed in a Veſſel by the Froſt ſhould break it, if it be not to hinder a Vacuity? But I anſwer, That that only happens, becauſe the Air over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, which as well as Earth and Water, tends to the Center, meeting with an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Tun by the way, takes up his Lodging there: If it find the pores of that Veſſel, that's to ſay, the ways that lead to that void place, too narrow, too long, and too crooked, with impatience it breaks through and arrives at its Tun.</p>
                  <p>But not to trifle away time, in anſwering all their objections, I dare be bold to ſay, That if there were no <hi>Vacuity,</hi> there could be no Motion; or elſe a Penetration of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57769:32"/> muſt be admitted; for it would be a little too ridiculous to think, that when a Gnat puſhes back a parcel of Air with its Wings, that parcel drives another before it, that other another ſtill; and that ſo the ſtirring of the little Toe of a Flea, ſhould raiſe a bunch upon the Back of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. When they are at a ſtand, they have recourſe to Rarefaction: But in good earneſt, How can it be when a Body is rarified, that one Particle of the Maſs does recede from another Particle, without leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an empty Space betwixt them; muſt not the two Bodies, which are juſt ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, have been at the ſame time in the ſame place of this; and that ſo they muſt have all three penetrated each other? I expect you'll ask me, why through a Reed, a Syringe or a Pump, Water is forced to aſcend contrary to its inclination? To which I anſwer, That that's by violence, and that it is not the fear of a <hi>Vacuity,</hi> that turns it out of the right way; but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing linked to the Air by an imperceptible Chain, it riſes when the Air, to which it is joined, is raiſed.</p>
                  <p>That's no ſuch knotty Difficulty, when one knows the perfect Circle, and the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Concatenation of the Elements: For if you attentively conſider the Slime, which joines the Earth and Water together in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57769:33"/> you'll find that it is neither Earth nor Water; but the Mediator betwixt theſe Two Enemies. In the ſame manner, the Water and Air reciprocally ſend a Miſt, that dives into the Humours of both, to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate a Peace betwixt them; and the Air is reconciled to the Fire, by means of an interpoſing Exhalation which Unites them.</p>
                  <p>I believe he would have proceeded in his Diſcourſe, had they not brought us our Victuals; and ſeeing we were a hungry, I ſtopt my Ears to his diſcourſe, and opened my Stomack to the Food they gave us.</p>
                  <p>I remember another time, when we were upon our Philoſophy, for neither of us took pleaſure to Diſcourſe of mean things: I am vexed, ſaid he, to ſee a Wit of your ſtamp, infected with the Errors of the Vulgar. You muſt know then, in ſpight of the Pedantry of
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> with which your Schools in <hi>France</hi> ſtill ring, That every thing is in every thing; that's to ſay, for inſtance, That in the Water there is Fire, in the Fire Water, in the Air Earth, and in the Earth Air: Though that Opinion makes Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars open their Eyes as big as Sawcers, yet it is eaſier to prove it, than perſwade it. For I ask them, in the firſt place, if Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter does not breed Fiſh: If they deny it, let them dig a Pit, fill it with meer Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57769:33"/> and to prevent all blind Objections, let them if they pleaſe, ſtrain it through a Strainer, and I'll oblige my ſelf, in caſe they find no Fiſh therein, within a certain time, to drink up all the Water they have poured into it: But if they find Fiſh, as I make no doubt on't; it is a convincing Argument, that there is both Salt and Fire there. Conſequentially now, to find Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Fire; I take it to be no difficult Task. For let them chuſe Fire, even that which is moſt abſtracted from Matter, as Comets are, there is a great deal in them ſtill; ſeeing if that Unctuous Humour, whereof they are engendred, being redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a Sulphur, by the heat of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periſtaſis which kindles them, did not find a curb of its Violence in the humid Cold, that qualifies and reſiſts it, it would ſpend it ſelf in a trice like Lightning. Now that there is Air in the Earth, they will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it; or otherwiſe they have never heard of the terrible Earth-quakes, that have ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſhaken the Mountains of <hi>Sicily:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Earth is full of Pores, even to the leaſt grains of Sand that compaſs it. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, no Man hath as yet ſaid, that theſe Hollows were filled with <hi>Vacuity:</hi> It will not be taken amiſs then, I hope, if the Air takes up its quarters there. It remains to be proved, that there is Earth in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57769:34"/> the Air; but I think it ſcarcely worth my pains, ſeeing you are convinced of it, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as you ſee, ſuch numberleſs Legions of Atomes fall upon your heads, as even ſtiffle Arithmetick.</p>
                  <p>But let us paſs from ſimple to compound Bodies, they'll furniſh me with much more frequent Subjects; and to demonſtrate that all things are in all things, not that they change into one another, as your
<hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> Juggle, (for I will maintain to their Teeth, that the Principles mingle, ſeparate, and mingle again in ſuch a manner, that that hath been made Water by the Wiſe Creator of the World, will always be Water:) I ſhall ſuppoſe no Maxime, as they do, but what I prove.</p>
                  <p>And therefore take a Billet, or any other combuſtible ſtuff, and ſet Fire to it, they'll ſay when it is in a Flame, That what was Wood is now become Fire; but I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the contrary, and that there is no more Fire in it, when it is all in Flame, than before it was kindled; but that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was hid in the Billet, and by the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity and Cold hindered from acting; being now aſſiſted by the Stronger, hath rallied its forces againſt the Phlegm that choaked it, and commanding the Field of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that was poſſeſſed by its Enemy, triumphs over his Jaylor, and appears without Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57769:34"/> Don't you ſee how the Water flees out at the two ends of the Billet, hot and ſmoaking from the Fight it was engaged in. That flame which you ſee riſe on high, is the purer Fire, unpeſtered from the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by conſequence the readieſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home to it ſelf: Nevertheleſs it Unites it ſelf, by tapering into a Piramide, till it riſe to a certain height, that it may pierce through the thick Humidity of the Air, which reſiſts it; but as in mounting it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engages it ſelf by little and little, from the violent company of its Landlords; ſo it diffuſes it ſelf, becauſe then it meets with nothing that thwarts its paſſage, which negligence, though, is many times the cauſe of a ſecond Captivity: For marching ſtragglingly, it wanders ſometimes into a Cloud, and if it meet there with a Party of its own, ſufficient to make head againſt a Vapour; they Engage, Grumble, Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Roar, and the Death of Innocents is many times the effect of the animated Rage, of thoſe inanimated Things. If when it finds it ſelf peſtered, among thoſe Crudities of the middle Region, it is not ſtrong enough to make a defence; it yields to its Enemy upon diſcretion, which by its weight, conſtrains it to fall again to the Earth: And this Wretch, incloſed in a drop of Rain, may, perhaps, fall at the Foot of an
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57769:35"/> Oak, whoſe Animal Fire will invite the poor Straggler, to take a Lodging with him; and thus you have it in the ſame condition again, as it was a few Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>But let us trace the Fortune of the other Elements, that compoſed that Billet. The Air retreats to its own Quarters alſo, though blended with Vapours; becauſe the Fire all in a rage, drove them briskly out
<hi>Pell-mell</hi> together. Now you have it ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Winds for a Tennis-ball, furniſhing Breath to Animals, filling up the Vacuities that Nature hath left; and, it may be, alſo wrapt up in a drop of Dew, ſuckling the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty Leaves of that Tree, whither our Fire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated: The Water driven from its Throne by the Flame, being by the heat elevated to the Nurſery of the Meteors, will diſtil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in Rain upon our Oak, as ſoon as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another; and the Earth being turned to Aſhes, and then cured of its Sterility, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the nouriſhing Heat of a Dunghill, on which it hath been thrown, or by the vegetative Salt of ſome neighbouring Plants, or by the teeming Waters of ſome Rivers, may happen alſo to be near this Oak, which by the heat of its Germ, will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it, and convert it into a part of its bulk.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:57769:35"/> In this manner, theſe Four Elements un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the ſame Deſtiny, and return to the ſame State, which they quitted but a few days before: So that it may be ſaid, that all that's neceſſary for the compoſition of a Tree, is in a Man; and in a Tree, all that's neceſſary for making of a Man. In fine, according to this way, all things will be found in all things; but we want a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus,</hi> to pluck us out of the Boſom of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and render us ſenſible, which I am willing to call the
<hi>Firſt Matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe were the things, I think, with which we paſt the time; for that little <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> had a quaint Wit. Our converſation, however, was only in the Night time; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe from Six a clock in the morning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til night, Crowds of the People that came to ſtare at us in our Lodging, would have diſturbed us: For ſome threw us Stones, others Nuts, and others Graſs; there was no talk, but of the Kings Beaſts; we had our Victuals daily at ſet hours, and the King and Queen took the pains often to feel my Belly, to ſee if I did not begin to ſwell, for they had an extraordinary deſire to have a Race of theſe little Animals. I cannot tell, whether it was that I minded their Geſtures and Tones, more than my Male did: But I learnt ſooner than he, to underſtand their Language, and to ſmatter
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57769:36"/> a little in it, which made us to be lookt upon, in another gueſs manner than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and the news thereupon flew preſently all over the Kingdom, that two Wild Men had been found, who were leſs than other Men, by reaſon of the bad Food we had had in the Deſarts; and who through a defect of their Parents Seed, had not the fore Legs ſtrong enough to ſupport their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>This belief would have taken rooting, by being ſpread, had it not been for the Learned Men of the Country, who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, ſaying, That it was horrid Impiety to believe, not only Beaſts, but Monſters to be of their kind. It would be far more probable, (added the calmer Sort) that our Domeſtick Beaſts, ſhould participate of the priviledge of Humanity, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Immortality, as being bred in our Country, than a Monſtrous Beaſt, that talks of being born I know not where, in the Moon; and then obſerve the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and them. We walk upon Four Feet, becauſe God would not truſt ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a thing, upon weaker Supporters, and he was afraid leaſt marching other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſome Miſchance might befall Man; and therefore he took the pains, to reſt him upon four Pillars, that he might not fall, but diſdaining to have a hand in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57769:36"/> the Fabrick of theſe two Brutes, he left them to the Caprice of Nature, who not concerning her ſelf with the loſs of ſo ſmall a matter, ſupported them only by Two Feet.</p>
                  <p>Birds themſelves, ſaid they, have not had ſo hard meaſure as they; for they have got Feathers, at leaſt to ſupply the weakneſs of their Legs, and to caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Air, when we purſue them; whereas Nature, depriving theſe Monſters of Two Legs, hath diſabled them from ſcaping our Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, conſider a little how they have the Head raiſed toward Heaven, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God would puniſh them with ſcarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all things, that he hath ſo placed them; for that ſupplicant Poſture, ſhews that they complain to Heaven of him that Created them, and that they beg Permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make their beſt of our Leavings. But we, on the contrary, have the Head bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downwards, to behold the Bleſſings, whereof we are the Maſters, and as if there were nothing in Heaven, that our happy condition needed Envy.</p>
                  <p>I heard ſuch Diſcourſes, or the like, daily at my Lodge; and at length they ſo curb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the minds of the people, as to that point, that it was decreed, That at beſt, I ſhould only paſs for a Parrot without Feathers;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57769:37"/> for they confirmed thoſe, who were already perſwaded, in that I had but two Legs no more than a Bird, which was the cauſe that I was put into a Cage, by expreſs orders from the Privy Council.</p>
                  <p>There the Queen's Bird-keeper, taking the pains daily to teach me to Whiſtle, as they do Stares or Singing-Birds here, I was really happy in that I wanted not Food: In the mean while, with the Sonnets the Spectators ſtunned me, I learnt to ſpeak as they did; ſo that when I was got to be ſo much Maſter of the Idiom, as to expreſs moſt of my thoughts, I told them the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of my Conceits. The Quaintneſs of my Sayings, was already the entertainment of all Societies, and my Wit was ſo much eſteemed, that the Council was obliged to Publiſh an Edict, forbidding all People to believe, that I was endowed with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; with expreſs Commands to all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of what Quality or Condition ſoever, not to imagine, but that whatever I did, though never ſo wittily, proceeded only from Inſtinct.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the deciſion of what I was, divided the Town into Two Factions. The party that ſtood for me, encreaſed daily; and at length in ſpight of the <hi>Anathema,</hi> whereby they endeavoured to ſcare the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: They who held for me, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57769:37"/> a Convention of the States, for determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Controverſie. It was long before they could agree, in the Choice of thoſe who ſhould have a Vote; but the Arbitrators pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the heat, by making the number of both parties equal, who ordered that I ſhould be brought unto the Aſſembly, as I was: But I was treated there with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Severity. My Examiners, amongſt other things, put queſtions of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy to me; I ingenuouſly told them, all that my Tutor had heretofore taught me, but they eaſily refuted me by more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Arguments: So that having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to anſwer for my ſelf, my laſt refuge was to the Principles of
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which ſtood me in as little ſtead, as his Sophiſms did; for in two Words, they let me ſee the falſity of them. That ſame
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſaid they, whoſe Learning you brag ſo much of, did without doubt accommodate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to his Philoſophy; inſtead of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating his Philoſophy to Principles; and beſides he ought to have proved them, at leaſt to be more rational, than thoſe of the other Sects, you mentioned to us: Wherefore the good Man will not take it ill, we hope, if we bid him God b'w'. In fine, when they perceived that I did nothing but bawl, that they were not more knowing than <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and that I was
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57769:38"/> forbid to diſpute againſt thoſe who denied his Principles: They all unanimouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, That I was not a Man, but, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, a kind of <hi>Estriage,</hi> ſeeing I carried my Head upright like them, that I walked on two Legs; and that, in ſhort, but for a little Down, I was every way like one of them, ſo that the Bird-keeper was ordered to have me back to my Cage. I ſpent my time pretty pleaſantly there, for becauſe I had correctly learned their Language, the whole Court took pleaſure to make me prattle. The Queen's Maids, among the reſt, ſlipt always ſome Boon into my Basket; and the gentileſt of them all, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceived ſome kindneſs for me, was ſo tranſported with Joy, when in private I entertained her, with the manners and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements of the People of our World, and eſpecially our Bells, and other Inſtruments of Muſick, that ſhe proteſted to me, with Tears in her Eyes, That if ever I found my ſelf in a condition to fly back again to our World, ſhe would follow me with all her Heart.</p>
                  <p>One Morning early, having ſtarted out of my Sleep, I found her Taboring upon the grates of my Cage: Take good heart, ſaid ſhe to me, yeſterday in Council, a War was reſolved upon, againſt the King
<gap reason="symbol" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                     </gap> I hope that during the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57769:38"/> hurry of Preparations, whilſt our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch and his Subjects are abſent, I may find an occaſion to make your eſcape. How, a War, ſaid I interruping her, have the Princes of this World, then, any quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels amongſt themſelves, as thoſe of ours have? Good now, let me know their way of Fighting.</p>
                  <p>When the Arbitrators, replied ſhe, who are freely choſen by the two Parties, have appointed the time for raiſing Forces for their March, the number of Combatants, the day and place of Battle, and all with ſo great equality, that there is not one Man more in one Army, than in the other: All the maimed Soldiers on the one ſide, are liſted in one Company; and when they come to engage, the <hi>Mareſhalls de Camp,</hi> take care to expoſe them to the maimed of the other ſide: The Giants are matched with Coloſſes, the Fencers with thoſe that can handle their Weapons, the Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant with the Stout, the Weak with the Infirm, the Sick with the Indiſpoſed, the Sturdy with the Strong; and if any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſtrike at another, than the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy he is matched with, unleſs he can make it out, that it was by miſtake, he is Condemned for a Coward. When the Battle is over, they take an account of the Wounded, the Dead and the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57769:39"/> for Run-aways they have none; and if the loſs be equal on both ſides, they draw Cuts, who ſhall be Proclaimed Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>But though a Kingdom hath defeated the Enemy in open War, yet there is hardly any thing got by it; for there are other ſmaller Armies of Learned and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Men, on whoſe Diſputations the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph or Servitude of States wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.</p>
                  <p>One Learned Man grapples with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one Wit with another, and one Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Man with another Judicious Man: Now the Triumph which a State gains in this manner, is reckoned as good as three Victories by open force. After the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of Victory, the Aſſembly is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, and the Victorious People, either chuſe the Enemies King to be theirs, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their own.</p>
                  <p>I could not forbear to Laugh, at this ſcrupulous way of giving Battle; and for an Example of much ſtronger Politicks, I alledged the Cuſtoms of our <hi>Europe,</hi> where the Monarch would be ſure, not to let ſlip any favourable occaſion of gaining the day; but mind what ſhe ſaid as to that.</p>
                  <p>Tell me, pray, if your Princes uſe not a pretext of Right, when they levy Arms: No doubt, anſwered I, and of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57769:39"/> the Juſtice of their Cauſe too. Why then, replied ſhe, do they not chuſe Impartial and Unſuſpected Arbitrators to compoſe their Differences? And if it be found, that the one has as much Right as the other, let things continue as they were; or let them play a game at <hi>Picket,</hi> for the Town or Province that's in diſpute.</p>
                  <p>But why all theſe Circumſtances, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied I, in your way of Fighting? Is it not enough, that both Armies are equal in the number of Men? Your Judgment is Weak, anſwered ſhe. Would you think in Conſcience, that if you had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your Enemy, Hand to Hand, in an open Field, you had fairly overcome him, if you had had on a Coat of Mail, and he none; if he had had but a Dagger, and you a Tuck; and in a Word, if he had had but one Arm, and you both yours? Nevertheleſs, what Equality ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you may recommend to your Gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, they never fight on even terms; for the one will be a tall Man, and the other Short; the one skilful at his Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and the other a Man that never handled a Sword; the one will be ſtrong, and the other Weak: And though theſe Diſproportions were not, but that the one were as skillful and ſtrong as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet ſtill they might not be rightly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57769:40"/> matched; for one, perhaps, may have more Courage than the other, who being raſh and hot-headed, inconcerned in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as not foreſeeing it, of a bilious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, a more contracted Heart, with all the qualities that conſtitute Courage, (as if that, as well as a Sword, were not a Weapon which his Adverſary hath not:) He makes nothing of falling deſperately, upon terrifying and killing this poor Man, who foreſees the danger; has his Heat choked in Phlegme, and a Heart too wide to cloſe in the Spirits in ſuch a poſture, as is neceſſary for thawing that Ice, which is called Cowardiſe. And now you praiſe that Man, for having kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Enemy at odds, and praiſing him for his Boldneſs, you praiſe him for a Sin againſt nature; ſeeing ſuch Boldneſs tends to its deſtruction. And this puts me in mind to tell ye, that ſome Years ago, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication was made to the Council of War, for a more circumſpect and conſcientious Rule to be made, as to the way of Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Philoſopher who gave the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, if I miſtake it not, ſpake in this manner.</p>
                  <p>You imagine, Gentlemen, that you have very equally balanced the advantages of two Enemies, when you have choſen both Tall Men, both skillful, and both couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: But that's not enough, ſeeing after
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57769:40"/> all, the Conquerour muſt have the better on't, either through his Skill, Strength, or good Fortune. If it be by Skill, without doubt he hath taken his Adverſary on the blind ſide, which he did not expect; or ſtruck him ſooner than was likely, or faining to make his Paſs on one ſide, he hath attacked him on the other: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs all this is Cunning, Cheating, and Treachery, and none of theſe make a brave Man: If he hath triumphed by Force, would you judge his Enemy over-come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath been over-powered? No; doubtleſs, no more than you'll ſay, that a Man hath loſt the Victory, when over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd by a Mountain, it was not in his power to gain it: Even ſo, the other was not overcome, becauſe he was not in a ſuitable Diſpoſition, at that nick of time, to reſiſt the violences of his Adverſary. If Chance hath given him the better of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, Fortune ought then to be Crowned, ſince he hath contributed nothing to it; and, in fine, the vanquiſhed is no more to be blamed, than he who at Dice having thrown Seventeen, is beat by another that throws three Sixes.</p>
                  <p>They confeſſed he was in the right; but that it was impoſſible, according to humane Appearances, to remedy it; and that it was better, to ſubmit to a ſmall inconvenience,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57769:41"/> than to open a door to a hundred of greater Importance.</p>
                  <p>She entertained me no longer at that time, becauſe ſhe was afraid to be found alone with me ſo early; not that Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicity is a Crime in that Country: On the contrary, except Malefactors Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, all Men have power over all Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and in the ſame manner, a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may bring her Action againſt a Man for refuſing her: But ſhe durſt not keep me company publickly, becauſe the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Council, at their laſt meeting, had ſaid, That it was chiefly the Women who gave it out that I was a Man, that under that pretext they might cover the violent deſire they had of enjoying Beaſts, and of committing with me ſins againſt Nature, without a bluſh; which was the reaſon, that for a long time, I neither ſaw her, nor any other of her Sex.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, ſome muſt needs have revived the Diſputes, about the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of my Being; for whilſt I was thinking of nothing elſe, but of dying in my Cage, I was once more brought out to have another Audience. I was then queſtioned, in preſence of a great many Courtiers, upon ſome points of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy; and, as I take it, my Anſwers gave ſome kind of Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57769:41"/> for the Preſident declared to me at large, his thoughts concerning the ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the World. They ſeemed to me very ingenious; and had he not traced it to its Original, which he maintained to be Eternal, I ſhould have thought his Philoſophy more rational than our own: But as ſoon as I heard him maintain a Foppery, ſo contrary to our Faith, I broke with him; at which he did but laugh; and that obliged me to tell him, That ſince they were therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts with it, I began again to think, that their World was but a Moon. But then all cried, Don't you ſee here Earth, Rivers, Seas? what's all that then? No matter, ſaid I, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> aſſures us it is but a Moon; and if you had ſaid the contrary in the Schools, where I have been bred, you would have been hiſſed at. At this they all burſt out in laughter; you need not ask, if it was their Ignorance, that made them do ſo; for in the mean time I was carried back to my Cage.</p>
                  <p>But ſome more paſſionate Doctors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed, that I had the boldneſs to affirm, That the Moon, from whence I came, was a World; and that their World was no more but a Moon, thought it might give them a very juſt pretext, to have me condemned to the Water; for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57769:42"/> that's their way of rooting out Hereticks. For that end, they went in a Body, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the King, who promiſed them Juſtice; and order'd me once more to be brought to the Bar.</p>
                  <p>Now was I the third time Un-caged; and then the moſt Ancient ſpoke, and pleaded againſt me. I do not well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his Speech; becauſe I was too much frighted, to receive the tones of his Voice without diſorder; and becauſe alſo in declaiming, he made uſe of an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſtunn'd me with its noiſe: It was a Speaking-Trumpet, which he had choſen on purpoſe, that by its Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Sound he might rouſe them to my death; and by that Emotion of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, hinder Reaſon from performing its Office: As it happens in our Armies, where the noiſe of Drums and Trumpets, hinders the Souldiers from minding the importance of their Lives. When he had done, I roſe up to defend my Cauſe; but I was excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from it, by an Accident that will ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize you. Juſt as I had opened my Mouth, a Man, who with much ado had preſſed through the Crowd, fell at the King's Feet, and a long while rouled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon his Back in his preſence. This practice did not at all ſurprize me, becauſe I knew it to be the poſture they put
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57769:42"/> themſelves into, when they have a mind to be heard in publick: I only ſtopt my own Harangue, and gave Ear to his.</p>
                  <p>Juſt Judges, ſaid he, liſten to me; you cannot Condemn that Man, that Monkey or Parrot, for ſaying, That the Moon, from whence he comes, is a World; for if he be a Man, though he were not come from the Moon, ſince all Men are free, is not he free alſo, to imagine what he pleaſes? How, can you conſtrain him not to have Viſions, as well as you? You may very well force him to ſay, That the Moon is not a World, but he will not believe it for all that; for to believe a thing, ſome poſſibilities enclining more to the Yea, than to the Nay, muſt offer to ones Imagination: And unleſs you furniſh him with that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, or his own mind hit upon it, he may very well tell you, that he believes, but ſtill remain an Infidel.</p>
                  <p>I am now to prove, that he ought not to be condemned, if you liſt him in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Beaſts.</p>
                  <p>For ſuppoſe him to be an Animal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon, would it be rational in you to Condemn him, for offending againſt it? He hath ſaid, that the Moon is a World. Now Beaſts act only by the inſtinct of Nature: it is Nature then that ſays ſo, and not he: To think that wiſe Nature, who
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57769:43"/> hath made the World, and the Moon knows not her ſelf what it is; and that ye who have no more Knowledge, but what ye derive from her, ſhould more certainly know it, would be very Ridiculous. But if Paſſion ſhould make you renounce your Principles, and you ſhould ſuppoſe, that Nature does not guide Beaſts; bluſh, at leaſt, to think on't, that the Caprices of a Beaſt ſhould ſo diſcompoſe you. Really, Gentlemen, ſhould you meet with a Man come to the Years of Diſcretion, who made it his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to inſpect the Government of <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,</hi> giving a blow to one that had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown its Companion, impriſoning another that had robb'd its Neighbour of a grain of Corn, and inditing a third, for leaving its Eggs; would you not think him a mad Man, to be employed in things ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and to pretend to give Laws to Animals, that never had Reaſon? How will you then, moſt Venerable Aſſembly, juſtifie your ſelves, for being ſo concerned at the Caprices of that little Animal? Juſt Judges, I have no more to ſay.</p>
                  <p>When he had made an end, all the Hall rung again with a kind of Muſical Applauſe; and after all the Opinions had been canva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, during the ſpace of a large quarter of an hour, the King gave Sentence:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:57769:43"/> That for the future, I ſhould be reput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a Man, accordingly ſet at liberty; and that the Puniſhment of being Drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould be converted into a publick Diſgrace (the moſt honourable way of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying the Law in that Country) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I ſhould be obliged to retract openly, what I had maintained, in ſaying, That the Moon was a World, becauſe of the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, that the novelty of that opinion, might give to weak Brethren.</p>
                  <p>This Sentence being pronounced, I was taken away out of the Palace, richly Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but in deriſion, carried in a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Chariot, as on a Tribunal; which four Princes in Harneſs drew, and in all the publick places of the Town, I was forced to make this Declaration:</p>
                  <p>Good People, I declare to you, That this Moon here is not a Moon, but a World; and that that World below is not a World, but a Moon: This the Council thinks fit you ſhould believe. After I had Proclaimed this, in the five great places of the Town; my Advocate came and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me his Hand to help me down. I was in great amaze, when after I had Eyed him, I found him to be my Spirit; we were an hour in embracing one another: Come lodge with me, ſaid he, for if you return to Court, after a Publick Diſgrace,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57769:44"/> you will not be well lookt upon: Nay more, I muſt tell you, that you would have been ſtill amongſt the Apes yonder, as well as the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> your Companion; if I had not in all Companies publiſhed the vigour and force of your Wit, and gained from your Enemies, the protection of the great Men, in your favours. I ceaſed not to thank him all the way, till we came to his Lodgings; there he entertained me till Supper-time, with all the Engines he had ſet a work to prevail with my Enemies. Notwithſtanding, the moſt ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts they had uſed for riding the Mobile, to deſiſt from ſo unjuſt a Proſecution: But as they came to acquaint us, that Supper was upon the Table, he told me, that to bear me company that evening, he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited Two Profeſſors of the Univerſity of the Town to Sup with him: I'll make them, ſaid he, fall upon the Philoſophy, which they teach in this World, and by that means you ſhall ſee my Landlord's Son: He's as Witty a Youth as ever I met with; he would prove another
<hi>Socrates,</hi> if he could uſe his Parts aright, and not bury in Vice the Graces wherewith God continually viſits him, by affecting a Libertiniſm, as he does, out of a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Oſtentation and Affectation of the name of a Wit. I have taken Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57769:44"/> here, that I may lay hold on all Opportunities of Inſtructing him: He ſaid no more, that he might give me the Liberty to ſpeak, if I had a mind to it; and then made a ſign, that they ſhould ſtrip me of my diſgraceful Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in which I ſtill gliſtered.</p>
                  <p>The Two Profeſſors, whom we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, entered, juſt as I was undreſt, and we went to ſit down to Table, where the Cloth was laid, and where we found the Youth, he had mentioned to me, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to already. They made him a low Reverence, and treated him with as much reſpect, as a Slave does his Lord. I asked my Spirit the reaſon of that, who made me anſwer, that it was becauſe of his Age; ſeeing in that World, the Aged rendered all kind of Reſpect and Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Young; and which is far more, that the Parents obeyed their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo ſoon as by the Judgment of the Senate of Philoſophers, they had attained to the Years of Diſcretion. You are ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, continued he, at a Cuſtom ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that of your Country; but it is not all repugnant to Reaſon: For ſay, in your Conſcience, when a brisk young Man is at his Prime in Imagining, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Acting, is not he fitter to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern a Family, than a Decrepit piece of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57769:45"/> Threeſcore Years, dull and doting, whoſe Imagination is frozen under the Snow of Sixty Winters, who follows no other Guide, but what you call, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of happy Succeſſes; and yet are no more, but the bare effects of Chance, againſt all the Rules and Oeconomy of humane Prudence? And as for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he hath but little of that neither, though the people of your World make it the Portion of Old Age: But to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, they muſt know, That that which is called Prudence in an Old Man, is no more but a panick Apprehenſion, and a mad Fear of acting any thing, where there is danger: So that when he does not run a Risk, wherein a Young Man hath loſt himſelf; it is not that he foreſaw the Cataſtrophe, but becauſe he had not Fire enough to kindle thoſe noble Flaſhes, which make us dare: Whereas the Boldneſs of that Young Man, was as a pledge of the good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his deſign; becauſe the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour that ſpeeds and facilitates the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thruſt him upon the undertaking. As for Execution, I ſhould wrong your Judgment; if I endeavoured to convince it by proofs: You know that Youth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is proper for Action; and were you ont fully perſwaded of this, tell me, pray,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57769:45"/> when you reſpect a Man of Courage, is it not becauſe he can revenge you on your Enemies or Oppreſſors? And does any thing, but meer Habit, make you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him, when a Battalion of Seventy <hi>Januarys</hi> hath frozen his Blood, and chilled all the noble Heats that youth is warmed with? When you yeild to the Stronger, is it not that he ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to you for a Victory, which you can Diſpute him? Why then ſhould you ſubmit to him, when Lazineſs hath ſoftened his Muſcles, weakened his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, evaporated his Spirits, and ſuckt the Marrow out of his Bones? If you adore a Woman, is it not becauſe of her Beauty? Why ſhould you then continue your Cringes, when Old Age hath made her a Ghoſt, which only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents a hideous Picture of Death? In ſhort, When you loved a Witty Man, it was becauſe by the Quickneſs of his Apprehenſion, he unravelled an intricate Affair, ſeaſoned the choiceſt Companies with his quaint Sayings, and ſounded the depth of Sciences with a ſingle Thought; and do you ſtill honour him, when his worn Organs diſappoint his weak Nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, when he is become dull and uneaſy in Company, and when he looks like an aged Fairy rather than a rational Man?

<hi>Caeſar,</hi> of whom moſt part died under Fourty Years of Age, could have merited no Honours, as being too Young in your account, though their Youth was the only cauſe of their Famous Actions; which a more advanced Age would have render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ineffectual, as wanting that Heat and Promptitude, that rendered them ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceſsful. But you'll tell me, that all the Laws of your World, do carefully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join the Reſpect that is due to Old Men: That's true; but it is as true alſo, that all who made Laws, have been Old Men, who feared that Young Men might juſtly have diſpoſſeſſed them of the Authority they had uſurped —</p>
                  <p>You owe nothing to your mortal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitector, but your Body only; your Soul comes from Heaven, and Chance might have made your Father your Son, as now you are his. Nay, are you ſure he hath not hindered you from Inheriting a Crown? Your Spirit left Heaven, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with a deſign to animate the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the Womb of the Empereſs; it caſually encountered the <hi>Embryo</hi> of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57769:47"/> you by the way, and it may be to ſhorten its journey, went and lodged there: No, no, God would never have razed your name out of the Liſt of Mankind, though your Father had died a Child. But who knows, whether you might not have been at this day the work of ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Captain, that would have aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you to his Glory, as well as to his Eſtate. So that, perhaps, you are no more indebted to your Father, for the life he hath given you, than you would be to a Pirate who had put you in Chains, becauſe he feeds you: Nay, grant he had begot you a Prince, or King; a Preſent loſes its merit, when it is made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Option of him who receives it.
<hi>Caeſar</hi> was killed, and ſo was <hi>Caſſius</hi> too: In the mean time <hi>Caſſius</hi> was obliged to the Slave, from whom he begg'd his Death, but ſo was not <hi>Caeſar</hi> to his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, who forced it upon him. Did your Father conſult your Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, when he Embraced your Mother? Did he ask you, if you thought fit to ſee that Age, or to wait for another; if you would be ſatisfied to be the Son of a Sot, or if you had the Ambition to ſpring from a Brave Man? Alas, you whom alone the buſineſs concerned, were
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57769:48"/> the only Perſon not conſulted in the caſe. May be then, had you been ſhut up any where elſe, than in the Womb of Nature's Ideas, and had your Birth been in your own Opinion, you would have ſaid to the
<hi>Parca,</hi> my dear Lady, take another Spindle in your Hand: I have lain very long in the Bed of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and I had rather continue an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ſtill without a Being, than to Be to day, that I may repent of it to morrow: However, Be you muſt, it was to no purpoſe for you to whimper and ſquall, to be back again, at the long and darkſome Houſe they drew you out of, they made as if they believed you cryed for the Teat.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Reaſons, at leaſt ſome of them, my Son, why Parents bear ſo much reſpect to their Children: I know very well, that I have inclined to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens ſide, more than in juſtice I ought; and that in favour of them, I have ſpoken a little againſt my Conſcience. But ſince I was willing to repreſs the Pride of ſome Parents, who inſult over the weakneſs of their little Ones; I have been forced to do as they do, who to make a crooked Tree ſtreight, bend it to the contrary ſide, that betwixt two Converſions it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57769:48"/> even: Thus I have made Fathers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to their Children what they have taken from them, by taking from them a great deal that belonged to them; that ſo another time they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their own. I know very well alſo, that by this Apology I have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Old men: But let them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that they were Children before they were Fathers, and Young before they were Old; and that I muſt needs have ſpoken a great deal to their advantage, ſeeing they were not found in a Parſley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: But, in fine, fall back, fall edge, though my Enemies draw up againſt my Friends, it will go well enough ſtill with me; for I have obliged all men, and only diſobliged but one half.</p>
                  <p>With that he held his tongue, and our Landlord's Son ſpake in this manner: Give me leave, ſaid he to him, ſince by your care I am informed of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Hiſtory, Cuſtoms, and Philoſophy of the World, of this little Man; to add ſomething to what you have ſaid; and to prove that Children are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Parents for their Generation, becauſe their Parents were obliged in Conſcience to procreate them.</p>
                  <p>The ſtricteſt Philoſophy of their World
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57769:49"/> acknowledges that, it is better to dye, ſince to dye, one muſt have lived, than not to have had a Being. Now ſeeing, by not giving a Being to that Nothing, I leave it in a ſtate worſe than Death, I am more guilty in not producing, than in killing it. In the mean time, my little Man, thou wouldſt think thou hadſt committed an unpardonable Parra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, ſhouldſt thou have cut thy Sons throat: It would indeed be an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Crime, but it is far more execrable, not to give a Being to that which is capable of receiving it: For that Child whom thou depriveſt of life for ever, hath had the ſatisfaction of having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed it for ſome time. Beſides, we know that it is but deprived of it, but for ſome ages; but theſe forty poor little Nothings, which thou mighteſt have made forty good Souldiers for the King, thou art ſo malicious as to deny them Life, and letteſt them corrupt in thy Reins, to the danger of an Apoplexy, which will ſtifle thee.</p>
                  <p>This Philoſophy did not at all pleaſe me, which made me three or four times ſhake my Head; but our Preceptor held his tongue, becauſe Supper was mad to be gone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:57769:49"/> We laid our ſelves along, then, upon very ſoft Quilts, covered with large Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets; and a young man that waited on us, taking the oldeſt of our Philoſophers, led him into a little arlour apart, where my Spirit called to him, to come back to us, aſſoon as he had ſupped.</p>
                  <p>This humour of eating ſeparately, gave me the curioſity of asking the Cauſe of it: He'll not reliſh, ſaid he, the ſteam of Meat, nor yet of Herbs, unleſs they die of themſelves, becauſe he thinks they are ſenſible of Pain. I wonder not ſo much, replied I, that he abſtains from Fleſh, and all things that have had a ſenſitive Life: For in our World the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoreans,</hi> and even ſome holy <hi>Anchorites,</hi> have followed that Rule; but not to dare, for inſtance, cut a Cabbage, for fear of hurting it; that ſeems to me altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ridiculous. And for my part, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered my Spirit, I find a great deal of probability in his Opinion.</p>
                  <p>For tell me, Is not that Cabbage you ſpeak of, a Being exiſtent in Nature, as well as you? Is not ſhe the common Mother of you both? Nay it would even ſeem that ſhe hath taken more care of the Vegetable, than of the Rational, ſince ſhe hath referred the Generation of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57769:50"/> a Man to the Caprices of his Father, who may, according as he has a mind to it, beget him, or not beget him: A rigour wherewith ſhe hath not treated the Cabbage; for inſtead of remitting it to the diſcretion of the Father, to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Son, as if ſhe had been more fearful, leaſt the Race of Cabbage ſhould periſh, than that of Man; ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them, whether they will or no, to give a Being to another, and not ſo as Men, who engender not, but according to their Whimſeys; and who, during their whole life, cannot procreate above a Score; whereas Cabbages can produce many Thouſands a Head. Yet the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that Nature is kinder to Mankind, than to Cabbage-kind, tickles and makes us laugh: But ſeeing ſhe is incapable of Paſſion, ſhe can neither love, nor hate any thing; and were ſhe ſuſceptible of Love, ſhe would rather beſtow her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection upon this Cabbage, which you grant cannot offend her, than upon that Man who would deſtroy her, if it lay in his power. And moreover, Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be born Innocent, being a Part of the firſt Offendor: But we know very well, that the firſt Cabbage did not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend its Creator. If it be ſaid, that we
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57769:50"/> are made after the Image of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, and ſo is not the Cabbage; grant that to be true; yet by polluting our Soul, wherein we reſembled Him, we have effaced that Likeneſs, ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more contrary to God than Sin. If then our Soul be no longer his Image, we reſemble him no more in our Feet, Hands, Mouth, Forehead and Ears, than a Cabbage in its Leaves, Flowers, Stalk, Pith, and Head: Do not you really think, that if this poor Plant could ſpeak, when one cuts it, it would not ſay, Dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man, what have I done to thee that deſerves Death? I never grow but in Gardens, and am never to be found in deſart places, where I might live in Security: I diſdain all other company but thine; and ſcarcely am I ſowed in thy Garden, when to ſhew thee my Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, I blow, ſtretch out my Arms to thee; offer thee my Children in Grain; and as a requital for my civility, thou cauſeſt my Head to be chopt off. Thus would a Cabbage diſcourſe, if it could ſpeak. Well, and becauſe it cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, may we therefore juſtly do it all the Wrong which it cannot hinder? If I find a Wretch bound Hand and Foot, may I lawfully kill him, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57769:51"/> defend himſelf; ſo far from that, that his Weakneſs would aggravate my Cruelty? And though this wretched Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be poor, and deſtitute of all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which we have, yet it deſerves not Death; and when of all the Benefits of a Being, it hath only that of Encreaſe, we ought not cruelly to ſnatch that away from it. To maſſacre a Man, is not ſo great Sin, as to cut and kill a Cabbage, becauſe one day the Man will riſe again, but the Cabbage has no other Life to hope for: By putting to death a Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage, you annihilate it; but in killing a Man, you make him only change his Habitation: Nay, I'll go farther with you ſtill, ſince God doth equally cheriſh all his Works, and hath equally divided his Benefits betwixt Us, and Plants, it is but juſt we ſhould have an equal Eſteem for Them, as for our Selves. It is true, we were born firſt, but in the Family of God there is no Birth-right. If then the Cabbage ſhare not with us in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of Immortality, without doubt, that Want was made up by ſome other Advantage, that may make amends for the ſhort neſs of its Being; may be by an univerſal Intellect, or a perfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all things in their Cauſes;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57769:51"/> and it's for that Reaſon, that the wiſe Mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all things, hath not ſhaped for it Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans like ours, which are proper only for a ſimple Reaſoning, not only weak, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times fallacious too; but others, more ingeniouſly framed, ſtronger, and more numerous, which ſerve to manage its Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Exerciſes. You'll ask me, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, when ever any Cabbage, imparted thoſe lofty Conceptions to us? But tell me, again, who ever diſcovered to us cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Beings, which we allow to be above us; to whom, we bear no Analogy, nor Proportion, and whoſe Exiſtence, it is as hard for us to comprehend, as the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Ways, whereby a Cabbage expreſſes its ſelf to its like, though not to us, becauſe our Senſes are too dull to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate ſo far.</p>

                     <hi>Moſes,</hi> the greateſt of Philoſophers, who drew the Knowledge of Nature, from the Fountain-Head, Nature her ſelf, hinted this truth to us, when he ſpoke of the Tree of Knowledge; and without doubt, he intended to intimate to us, under that Figure, that Plants, in Excluſion to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, poſſeſs perfect Philoſophy. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, then, O thou Proudeſt of Animals I that though a Cabbage which thou cutteſt, ſayeth not a Word, yet it pays it at Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but the poor Vegetable, has no fit
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57769:52"/> Organs to howl as you do, nor yet to frisk it about, and weep: Yet, it hath thoſe that are proper to complain of the Wrong you do it, and to draw a Judgement from Heaven upon you for the Injuſtice. But if you ſtill demand of me, how I come to know, that Cabbage and Coleworts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch pretty Thoughts? Then will I ask you, how come you to know that they do not? And that ſome amongſt them, when they ſhut up at Night, may not Compliment one another, as you do, ſaying: Good Night, Maſter
<hi>Cole-Curled-Pate;</hi> your moſt humble Servant, good Maſter
<hi>Cabbage-Round-Head.</hi>

                  <p>So far was he gone on in his Diſcourſe, when the young Lad, who had led out our Philoſopher, led him in again; What, Supped already? cryed my Spirit to him. He anſwered, yes, almoſt: The Phyſiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt having permitted him to take a little more with us. Our young Landlord ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, till I ſhould ask him the meaning of that Myſtery; I perceive, ſaid he, you wonder at this way of Living; know then, that in your World, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Health is too much neglected, and that our Method is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:57769:52"/> In all Houſes, there is a Phyſiognomiſt entertained by the Publick, who in ſome manner, reſembles your Phyſicians, ſave that he only preſcribes to the Healthful, and judges of the different manner, how we are to be Treated, only according to the Proportion, Figure, and Symetry of our Members; by the Features of the Face, the Complexion, the Softneſs of the Skin, the Agility of the Body, the Sound of the Voice, and the Colour, Strength, and Hardneſs of the Hair. Did not you juſt now mind a Man, of a pretty low Stature, why ey'd you; he was the Phyſiognomiſt of the Houſe: Aſſure your ſelf, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he obſerved your Conſtitution, he hath diverſified the Exhalation of your Supper: Mark the Quilt on which you lie, how diſtant it is from our Couches; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, he judged your Conſtitution to be far different from ours; ſince he feared, that the Odour which evaporates from thoſe little Pipkins, that ſtand under our Noſes, might reach you, or that yours might ſteam to us; at Night, you'll ſee him chuſe the Flowers for your Bed, with the ſame Circumſpection. During all this Diſcourſe, I made Signs to my Landlord, that he would try, if he could oblige the Philoſophers, to fall upon ſome head of the Science, which they profeſſed. He was
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57769:53"/> too much my Friend, not to ſtart an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion upon the Spot: But not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Reader, with the Diſcourſe, and Entreaties, that were previous to the Treaty, wherein Jeſt and Earneſt were ſo wittily interwoven, that it can hardly be imitated; I'll only tell you, that the Doctor, who came laſt, after many things, ſpake as follows:</p>
                  <p>It remains to be proved, that there are infinite Worlds, in an infinite World: Fancy to your ſelf then the Univerſe, as a great Animal, and that the Stars, which are Worlds, are in this great Animal, as other great Animals, that ſerve recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally for Worlds to other People. Such as we, our Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That we in our turns, are likewiſe Worlds to certain other Animals, incomparably leſs than our ſelves, ſuch as Nits, Lice, Hand-worms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that theſe are on Earth, to others more imperceptible ones; in the ſame manner, as every one of us, appears to be a great World, to theſe little People. Perhaps, our Fleſh, Blood, and Spirits, are nothing elſe, but a Contexture of little Animals that correſpond, lend us Motion from theirs, and blindly ſuffer themſelves to be guided by our Will, which is their Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; or otherwiſe conduct us, and all Conſpiring together, produce that Action
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57769:53"/> which we call Life. For tell me, pray, is it a hard thing to be believed, that a Louſe takes your Body for a World; and that when any one of them, travels from one of your Ears to the other, his Companions ſay, that he hath travelled the Earth, from end to end, or that he hath run from one Pole to the other? Yes, without doubt, thoſe little People, take your Hair for the Foreſts of their Country; the Pores full of Liquor, for Fountains; Buboes and Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for Lakes and Ponds; Boils, for Seas; and Defluxions, for Deluges: And when you Comb your ſelf, forwards, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, they take that Agitation, for the Flowing and Ebbing of the Ocean. Doth not Itching make good what I ſay? What is the little Worm that cauſes it, but one of theſe little Animals, which hath broken off from civil Society, that it may ſet up for a Tyrant in its Country? If you ask me, why are they bigger than other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible Creatures? I ask you, why are Elephants bigger than we? And the
<hi>Iriſh</hi>-men, than <hi>Spaniards?</hi> As to the Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Scurff, which you know not the Cauſe of; they muſt either happen by the Corruption of their Enemies, which theſe little Blades have killed, or which the Plague has cauſed by the ſcarcity of Food, for which the Seditious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57769:54"/> one another, and left Mountains of Dead Carcaſes rotting in the Field; or becauſe the Tyrant, having driven away on all Hands his Companions, who by their Bodies, ſtopt up the Pores of ours, hath made way out for the wateriſh Matter, which being extravaſated, and out of the Sphere of the Circulation of our Blood, is corrupted. It may be asked, perhaps, why a Nit, or Hand-worm, produces ſo many diſorders? But that's eaſily conceived; for as one Revolt begets another, ſo theſe little People, egg'd on by the bad Example of their Seditious Companions, aſpire ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Soveraign Command; and occaſion every where, War, Slaughter, and Famine. But you'll ſay, ſome are far leſs ſubject to Itching, than others; and, nevertheleſs, all are equally inhabited by theſe little Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, ſince you ſay, they are the Cauſe of our Life. That's true; for we obſerve, that Phlegmatick People, are not ſo much given to ſcratching as the Cholerick; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the People ſympathizing with the Climate they inhabit, are ſlower in a cold Body, than thoſe others that are heated by the temper of their Region, who frisk and ſtir, and cannot reſt in a place: Thus a Cholerick Man, is more delicate than a Phlegmatick; becauſe being animated in many more Parts, and the Soul, being
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57769:54"/> Action of theſe little Beaſts, he is capable of Feeling, in all places where thoſe Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtir. Whereas, the Phlegmatick Man, wanting ſufficient Heat to put that ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Mobile in Action, is ſenſible but in a few places; and to prove more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that univerſal
<hi>Vermicularity,</hi> you need but conſider, when you are wounded, how the Blood runs to the Sore: Your Doctors ſay, that it is guided by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Nature, who would ſuccour the parts debilitated; which might make us conclude, that, beſides the Soul and Mind, there were a third intellectual Subſtance, that had diſtinct Organs and Functions: And therefore, it ſeems to me far more Rational, to ſay, That theſe little Animals, finding themſelves attacked, ſend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Aſſiſtance from their Neighbours, and that Recruits flocking in from all Parts, and the Country being too little to contain ſo many, they either die of Hunger, or are ſtifled in the Preſs. That Mortality hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens when the Boil is ripe; for as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that theſe Animals at that time are ſtifled, the Fleſh becomes inſenſible: Now, if Blood-letting, which is many times ordered to divert the Fluxion, do any good, it is becauſe, much being loſt by the Orifice, which theſe little Animals laboured to ſtop, they refuſe their Allies
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57769:55"/> Aſſiſtance, having no more Forces, than is enough to defend themſelves at home.</p>
                  <p>Thus he concluded, and when the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Philoſopher, perceived by all our Looks, that we longed to hear him ſpeak in his turn:</p>
                  <p>Men, ſaid he, ſeeing you are curious to inſtruct this little Animal, (our like) in ſomewhat of the Science which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I am now dictating a Treatiſe, which I wiſh he might ſee, becauſe of the Light it gives to the Underſtanding of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy; it is an Explication of the Original of the World: But ſeeing I am in haſte to ſet my Bellows at work, (for to Morrow, without delay, the Town departs;) I hope you'll excuſe my want of time, and I promiſe to ſatisfie you, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as the Town is arrived, at the place whither it is to go.</p>
                  <p>At theſe words, the Landlord's Son cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Father, to know what it was a Clock? who having anſwered him, that it was paſt Eight, he asked him in a great Rage, Why he did not give him notice at Seven, according as he had commanded him, that he knew well enough, the Houſes were to be gone to Morrow; and that the City Walls were already upon their Journey? Son, replyed the good Man, ſince you ſate down to Table, there is an Order publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57769:55"/> That no Houſe ſhall budg before next day: That's all one, anſwered the young Man; you ought blindly to obey, not to examine my Orders, and only remember what I commanded you. Quick, go fetch me your Effigies: So ſoon as it was brought, he took hold on't by the Arm, and Whipt it a whole quarter of an Hour: Away you ne'er be good, continued he, as a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for your diſobedience; it's my Will and Pleaſure, that this day you ſerve for a Laughing-ſtock to all People; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I command you, not to walk but upon two Legs, till Night. The Poor Man went out in a very mournful Condition, and the Young Man excuſed to us his Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>I had much ado, though I bit my Lip, to forbear Laughing at ſo pleaſant a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; and therefore to take me off of this odd piece of Pedantick Diſcipline, which, without doubt, would have made me burſt out at laſt; I prayed my Philoſopher to tell me, what he meant by that Journey of the Town, he talked of, and if the Houſes and Walls Travelled? Dear Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, anſwered he, we have ſome Ambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Towns, and ſome Sedentary; the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatory, as for inſtance, this wherein now we are, are Built in this manner: The Architector, as you ſee, builds every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of a very light ſort of Timber; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57769:56"/> by four Wheels underneath; in the thickneſs of one of the Walls, he places ten large pair of Bellows, whoſe Snouts paſs in a Horizontal Line, through the upper Story, from one Pinacle to the other; ſo that when Towns are to be removed, from one place to another, (for according to the Seaſons they change the Air) every one ſpreads a great many large Sails, upon one ſide of the Houſe, before the Noſes of the Bellows; then having wound up a Spring, to make them play, in leſs then Eight days time, their Houſes by the continual Puffs, which theſe Windy Monſters blow, are driven, if one pleaſes, an Hundred Leagues and more. For thoſe which we call Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary, they are almoſt like to your Towers; ſave that they are of Timber, and that they have a Great and Strong Skrew, or Vice in the Middle, reaching from the Top to the Bottom; whereby they may be hoiſted up, or let down as People pleaſe. Now the Ground under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, is dugg as deep as the Houſe is high; and it is ſo ordered, that ſo ſoon as the Froſts begin to chill the Air, they may ſink their Houſes down under Ground, where they keep themſelves ſecure from the Severity of the Weather: But aſſoon as the gentle Breathings of the Spring, begin to ſoften and qualifie the Air; they raiſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57769:56"/> them above Ground again, by means of the great Skrew I told you of. I prayed him, ſince he had ſhew'd me ſo much good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that the Town was not to part till next day, that he would tell me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of that Original of the World, which he had mentioned not long before; and I promiſe you, ſaid I, that in requital, ſo ſoon as I am got back to the Moon, from whence my Governour (pointing to my Spirit) will tell you that I am come, I'll ſpread your Renown there, by relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rare things you ſhall tell me: I perceive you Laugh at that promiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you do not believe, that the Moon, I ſpeak of, is a World, and that I am an Inhabitant of it; but I can aſſure you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that the People of that World, who take this only for a Moon, will Laugh at me, when I tell them that your Moon is a World, and that there are Fields, and Inhabitants in it: He anſwered only with a ſmile, and ſpake in this manner:</p>
                  <p>Since in Aſcending to the Original of this great
<hi>ALL,</hi> we are forced to run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three or four Abſurdities; it is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable we ſhould follow the way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may be leaſt apt to ſtumble. I ſay then, that the firſt Obſtacle that ſtops us ſhort, is the Eternity of the World; and the minds of men, not being able enough to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57769:57"/> conceive it, and being no more able to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that this great Univerſe, ſo lovely and ſo well ordered, could have made it ſelf, they have had their recourſe to Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But like to him that would leap into a River, for fear of being wet with Rain, they ſave themſelves out of the Clutches of a Dwarf, by running into the Arms of a Giant; and yet they are not ſafe for all that: For that Eternity which they deny the World, becauſe they cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it, they attribute it to God, as if he ſtood in need of that Preſent, and as if it were eaſier to imagine it, in the one than in the other; for tell me, pray, was it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet conceived in Nature, how Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be made of Nothing? Alas! betwixt Nothing and an Atome only, there are ſuch infinite Diſproportions, that the ſharpeſt Wit could never dive into them; therefore to get out of this inextricable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth, you muſt admit of a Matter Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal with God: But you'l ſay to me, grant I ſhould allow you that Eternal Matter; how could that Chaos diſpoſe and order it ſelf? That's the thing I am about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to you.</p>
                  <p>My little Animal, after you have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally divided every little Viſible Body, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an infinite many little inviſible Bodies; you muſt imagine, That the infinite Univerſe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57769:57"/> conſiſts only of theſe Atomes, which are moſt ſolid, moſt incorruptible, and moſt ſimple; whoſe Figures are partly Cubical, partly Parallelograms, partly Angular, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Round, partly Sharp-pointed, partly Pyramidal, partly Six-cornered, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Oval; which act all ſeverally, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Various Figures: And to ſhew that it is ſo, put a very round Ivory Bowl upon a very ſmooth place, and with the leaſt touch you give, it will be half a quarter of an hour before it reſt: Now I ſay, that if it were perfectly round, as ſome of the Atomes I ſpeak of are, and the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face on which it is put perfectly ſmooth, it would never reſt. If Art then be capable of inclining a Body to a perpetual Motion, why may we not believe that Nature can do it? It's the ſame with the other Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, of which the Square require a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Reſt, others an oblique Motion, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a half Motion, as Trepidation; and the Round, whoſe Nature is to move, joyning a Pyramidal, makes that, perhaps, which we call Fire; becauſe not only Fire is in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Agitation, but alſo becauſe it eaſily penetrates: Beſides, the Fire hath diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent effects, according to the opening and quality of the Angles, when the round Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure is joyned; for Example, The Fire of Pepper is another thing, than the Fire of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57769:58"/> Sugar, the Fire of Sugar differs from that of Cinnamon; that of Cinnamon, from that of the Clove; and this from the Fire of a Faggot. Now the Fire, which is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect of the parts and whole of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, hath driven together, and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated into an Oak, the quantity of Figures which are neceſſary for the Compoſition of that Oak: But you'l ſay, how could Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard congregate into one place, all the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures that are neceſſary for the production of that Oak? I anſwer, That it is no wonder that Matter ſo diſpoſed, ſhould form an Oak; but the wonder would have been greater, if the Matter being ſo diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Oak had not been produced, had there been a few leſs of ſome Figures, it would have been an Elm, a Poplar, a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and fewer of 'em ſtill, it would have been the Senſitive Plant, an Oyſter, a Worm, a Flie, a Frog, a Sparrow, an Ape, a Man. If three Dice being flung upon a Table, there happen a Raffle of two, or all, a three, a four, and a five, or two ſixes, and a third in the bottom, would you ſay, O ſtrange! that each Die ſhould turn up ſuch a chance, when there were ſo many others. A Sequence of three hath happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, O ſtrange! Two ſixes turned up, and the bottom of the third, O ſtrange! I am ſure that being a man of Senſe, you'l never
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57769:58"/> make ſuch Exclamations; for ſince there is but a certain quantity of Numbers upon the Dice, it's impoſſible but ſome of them muſt turn up; and you wonder, after that, how matter ſhuffled together
<hi>Pell-Mell,</hi> as Chance pleaſes, ſhould make a Man, ſeeing ſo many things were neceſſary for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his Being. You know not then, that this Matter tending to the Fabrick of a Man, hath been a Million of times ſtopt in it's Progreſs, for forming ſometimes a Stone, ſometimes Lead, ſometimes Coral, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Flower, ſometimes a Comet; and all becauſe of more or leſs Figures, that were required for the framing of a Man: So that it is no greater wonder, if amongſt infinite Matters, which inceſſantly change and ſtir, ſome have hit upon the conſtruction of the few Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals which we ſee, than if in a Hundred Caſts of the Dice, one ſhould throw a Raffle: Nay, indeed, it is impoſſible, that in this hurling of things, nothing ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; and yet this will be always admired by a Block-head, who little knows how ſmall a matter, would have made it to have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.

                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:57769:59"/> only runs, and ſometimes abſconds, you will not ſay, that that River hath a great deal of Wit, becauſe you know that it hath met with things, diſpoſed for producing ſuch rare Feats; for had not the Mill ſtood in the way, it would not have ground the Corn; had it not met the Clock, it would not have marked the Hours: and if the little Rivulet I ſpeak of, had met with the ſame Opportunities, it would have wrought the very ſame Miracles. Juſt ſo it is with the Fire that moves of it ſelf; for finding Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans fit for the Act of Reaſoning, it Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; when it finds only ſuch, as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Senſation, it Senſates; and when ſuch as are fit for Vegetation, it Vegetates. And to prove it is ſo, put out but the Eyes of a Man, the Fire of whoſe Soul makes him to ſee, and he will ceaſe to ſee; juſt as our great Clock will leave off to make the Hours, if the Movements of it be broken.</p>
                  <p>In fine, theſe Primary and indiviſible Atomes, make a Circle, whereon without difficulty move the moſt perplexed Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Natural Philoſophy, not ſo much as even the very Operation of the Senſes, which no Body hitherto hath been able to conceive, but I will eaſily explain by theſe little Bodies. Let us begin with the Sight. It deſerves, as being the moſt incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, our firſt Eſſay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:57769:59"/> It is performed then, as I imagine, when the Tunicles of the Eye, whoſe Pores re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble thoſe of Glaſs, tranſmitting that fiery Duſt, which is called Viſual Rays, the ſame is ſtopt by ſome opacous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which makes it recoil; and then, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its retreat the Image of the Object, that forced it back, and that Image, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but an infinite number of little Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, exhaled in an equal Superfice, from the Object beheld; it purſues it to our Eye: You'll not fail to Object, I know, that Glaſs is an Opacous Body, and very Compact; and that nevertheleſs, inſtead of reflecting other Bodies, it lets them paſs through: But I anſwer, that the Pores of Glaſs, are ſhaped in the ſame Figure, as thoſe Atomes are which paſs through it; and as a Wheat-Sieve is not proper for Sifting of Oats, nor an Oat-Sieve to Sift Wheat; ſo a Box of Deal-Board, though it be thin, and lets a ſound go through it, is impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable to the Sight; and a piece of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal, though tranſparent, and pervious to the Eye, is not penetrable to the Touch. I could not here forbear to interrupt him: A great Poet and Philoſopher of our World, ſaid I, hath, after <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Democritus,</hi> ſpoken of theſe little Bodies, in the ſame manner almoſt as you do; and therefore, you don't at all ſurpriſe me, by
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57769:60"/> that Diſcourſe: Only, tell me, I pray, as you proceed, how, according to your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, you'll explain to me, the manner of drawing your Picture in a Looking-Glaſs, That's very eaſie, replied he, for imagine with your ſelf, that thoſe Fires of our Eyes, having paſſed through the Glaſs, and meeting behind it an Opacous Body, that reverberates them, they come back the way they went; and finding thoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bodies, marching in equal Superfices upon the Glaſs, they repel them to our Eyes; and our Imagination, hotter than the other Faculties of our Soul, attracts the more ſubtile, wherewith it draws our Picture in little.</p>
                  <p>It is as eaſie to conceive the Act of Hearing, and for
<hi>Brevities</hi> ſake, let us only conſider it in the Harmony of a Lute, touched by the Hand of a Maſter. You'll ask me, How can it be, that I perceive at ſo great a diſtance, a thing which I do not ſee? Does there a Sponge go out of my Ears, that drinks up that Muſick, and brings it back with it again? Or does the Player, beget in my Head another little Muſician, with another little Lute, who has Orders like an Eccho, to ſing over to me the ſame Airs? No; But that Miracle proceeds from this, that the String touched, ſtriking thoſe little Bodies, of which the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57769:60"/> Air is compoſed, drives it gently into my Brain, with thoſe little Corporeal Nothings, that ſweetly pierce into it; and according as the String is ſtretched, the Sound is high, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it more vigorouſly drives the Atomes; and the Organ being thus penetrated, furniſheth the Fancy, wherewith to make a Repreſentation; if too little, then our Memory, not having as yet finiſhed its I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, we are forced to repeat the ſame ſound to it again; to the end it may take enough of Materials, which, for Inſtance, the Meaſures of a <hi>Saraband,</hi> furniſh it with, for finiſhing the Picture of that <hi>Saraband;</hi> but that Operation, is nothing near ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, as thoſe others, which by the help of the ſame Organ, excite us ſometimes to Joy, ſometimes to Anger.—</p>
                  <p>And this happens, when in that motion, theſe little Bodies, meet with other <hi>little</hi> Bodies within us, moving in the ſame manner, or whoſe Figure, renders them ſuſceptible of the ſame Agitation; for then theſe New-comers, ſtir up their Landlords to move as they do; &amp; thus, when a violent Air meets with the Fire of our Blood, it inclines it to the ſame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and animates it to a Sally, which is the thing we call Heat of Courage; if the Sound be ſofter, and have only force enough to raiſe a leſs Flame, in greater A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, by leading it along the Nerves,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57769:61"/> Membranes, and through the interſtices of our Fleſh, it excites that Tickling which is called Joy: And ſo it happens, in the Ebullition of the other Paſſions, according as theſe little Bodies, are more or leſs vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently toſſed upon us, according to the Motion they receive, by the rencounter of other Agitations, and according as they find Diſpoſitions in us for motion. So much for Hearing.</p>
                  <p>Now, I think the Demonſtration of Touching, will be every whit as eaſie; if we conceive, that out of all palpable Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there is a perpetual Emiſſion of little Bodies, and that the more we touch them, the more evaporate; becauſe, we preſs them out of the Subject it ſelf, as Water out of a Sponge, when we ſqueez it. The Hard, make a report to the Organ, of their Hardneſs; the Soft, of their Softneſs; the Rough,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that this is ſo, we are not ſo quaint in Feeling with Hands uſed to Labour, becauſe of the Thickneſs of the Skin, which being neither porous, nor animated, with difficulty tranſmits the Evaporations of Matter. Some, perhaps, may deſire to know, where the Organ of Touching has its Reſidence. For my part, I think it is ſpread over all the Surface of the Body, ſeeing in all parts it feels: Yet I imagine, that the nearer the Member, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57769:61"/> we touch, be to the Head, the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we diſtinguiſh; which Experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces us of, when with ſhut Eyes we handle any thing, for then we'll more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily gueſs what it is; and if on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we feel it with our hinder Feet, it will be harder for us to know it: And the Reaſon is, becauſe our Skin being all over perforated, our Nerves, which are of no compacter Matter, loſe by the way a great many of thoſe little Atomes, through the little Holes of their Contexture, before they reach the Brain, which is their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end: It remains, that I ſpeak of the Smelling and Taſting.</p>
                  <p>Pray tell me, when I taſte a Fruit, is it not becauſe the Heat of my Mouth melts it? Confeſs to me then, that there being Salts in a Pear, and that they being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Diſſolution, into little Bodies of a different Figure, from thoſe which make the Taſte of an Apple; they muſt needs pierce our Pallate, in a very different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Juſt ſo as the thruſt of a Pike, that paſſes through me, is not like the Wound which a Piſtol-Bullet makes me feel, with a ſudden ſtart; and as that Piſtol-Bullet, makes me ſuffer another ſort of Pain, than that of a Slug of Steel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:57769:62"/> I have nothing to ſay, as to the Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſeeing the Philoſophers themſelves confeſs, that it is performed by a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Emiſſion of little Bodies.</p>
                  <p>Now, upon the ſame Principle, will I explain to you, the Creation, Harmony, and Influence of the Celeſtial Globes, with the immutable Variety of Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.</p>
                  <p>He was about to proceed; but the Old Landlord coming in, made our Philoſopher think of withdrawing: He brought in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals full of Glow-worms, to light the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; but ſeeing thoſe little fiery Inſects, loſe much of their Light, when they are not freſh gathered, theſe which were ten days old, had hardly any at all. My Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſtayed not, till the Company ſhould complain of it, but went up to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and came immediately back again, with two Bowls of Fire ſo Sparkling, that all wondred he burnt not his Fingers. Theſe incombuſtible Tapers, ſaid he, will ſerve us better than your Week of Worms. They are Rays of the Sun, which I have purged from their Heat; otherwiſe, the corroſive qualities of their Fire, would have dazled, and offended your Eyes; I have fixed their Light, and incloſed it within theſe tranſparent Bowls. That ought not to afford you any great Cauſe of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57769:62"/> for it is not harder for me, who am a Native of the Sun, to condenſe his Beams, which are the Duſt of that World, than it is for you, to gather the Atomes of the pulveriz'd Earth of this World. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our Landlord ſent a Servant, to wait upon the Philoſophers home, it being then Night, with a dozen Globes of Glow-worms hanging at his four Legs. As for my Preceptor, and my ſelf, we went to reſt, by order of the Phiſiognomiſt. He laid me that Night in a Chamber of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and Lillies, ordered me to be tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led after the uſual manner; and next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about Nine a Clock, my Spirit came in, and told me, that he was come from Court, where
<gap reason="symbol" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                     </gap> One of the Queens Maids of Honour had ſent for him, and that ſhe had enquired after me, proteſting that ſhe ſtill perſiſted in her Deſign, to be as good as her Word; that is, that with all her Heart ſhe would follow me, if I would take her along with me to the other World; which exceedingly pleaſed me, ſaid he, when I underſtood, that the chief Motive, which inclined her to the Voyage, was to become Chriſtian: And therefore, I have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to forward her Deſign, what lies in me; and for that end, to invent a Machine, that may hold three or four, wherein you
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57769:63"/> may mount to day, both together, if you think fit. I'll go ſeriouſly ſet about the performance of my Undertaking; and in the mean time, to entertain you, during my Abſence, I leave you here a Book, which heretofore I brought with me from my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey; the Title of it is,
<hi>The States and Empires of the Sun, with an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Hiſtory of the Spark.</hi> I alſo give you this, which I eſteem much more, it is the great Work of the Philoſophers, compoſed by one of the greateſt Wits of the Sun. He proves in it, that all things are true, and ſhews the way of uniting Phyſically, the Truths of every Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; as, for Example, That White is Black, and Black White; that one may be, and not be at the ſame time; that there may be a Mountain without a Valley; that nothing is ſomething, and that all things that are, are not; but obſerve, that he proves all theſe unheard-of Paradoxes, without any Captious or Sophiſtical Argument. When you are weary of Reading, you may Walk, or Converſe with our Landlord's Son, he has a very Charming Wit; but that which I diſlike in him is, that he is a little Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical. If he chance to Scandalize you, or by any Argument ſhake your Faith, fail not immediately to come and propoſe it to me, and I'll clear the Difficulties of it; any
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57769:63"/> other, but I, would enjoin you to break Company with him; but ſince he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly proud and conceited, I am certain, he would take your flight for a Defeat, and would believe your Faith to be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on no Reaſon, if you refuſed to hear his. Having ſaid ſo, he left me; and no ſooner was his back turned, but I fell to conſider attentively my Books and their Boxes, that's to ſay, their Covers, which ſeemed to me to be wonderfully Rich; the one was cut of a ſingle Diamond, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more reſplendent than ours; the ſecond looked like a prodigious great Pearl, cloven in two. My Spirit had tranſlated thoſe Books into the Language of that World; but becauſe I have none of their Print, I'll now explain to you the Faſhion of theſe two Volumes.</p>
                  <p>As I opened the Box, <hi>I</hi> found within ſomewhat of Metal, almoſt like to our Clocks, full of I know not what little Springs, and imperceptible Engines: It was a Book, indeed; but a Strange and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Book, that had neither Leaves nor Letters: In fine, it was a Book, made wholly for the Ears, and not the Eyes. So that when any Body has a mind to read in it, he winds up that Machine, with a great many little Strings; then he turns the Hand to the Chapter which he deſires to hear,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57769:64"/> and ſtraight, as from the Mouth of a Man, or a Muſical Inſtrument, proceed all the diſtinct and different Sounds, which the
<hi>Lunar</hi> Grandees make uſe of, for expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Thoughts, inſtead of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                  <p>When I ſince reflected on this Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Invention, I no longer wondred, that the Young-Men of that Country, were more knowing at Sixteen, or Eighteen years Old, than the Gray-Beards of our Climate; for knowing how to Read as ſoon as Speak, they are never without Lectures, in their Chambers, their Walks, the Town, or Travelling; they may have in their Pockets, or at their Girdles, Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe Books, where they need but wind up a Spring, to hear a whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo more, if they have a mind to hear the Book quite through; ſo that you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want the Company of all the great Men, Living and Dead, who entertain you with Living Voices. This Preſent employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me about an hour; and then hanging them to my Ears, like a pair of Pendants, I went a Walking; but I was hardly at End of the Street, when I met a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of People very Melancholy.</p>
                  <p>Four of them carried upon their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, a kind of a Herſe, covered with Black: I asked a Spectator, what that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57769:64"/> like to a Funeral in my Country, meant? He made me anſwer, that that naughty <gap reason="symbol" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                     </gap> called ſo by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe of a knock he had received up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Right Knee; who being convicted of Envy and Ingratitude, died the day before; and that Twenty Years ago, the Parliament had Condemned him to die in his Bed, and then to be interred after his Death. I fell a Laughing at that Anſwer. And he asking me, why? You amaze me, ſaid I, that that which is counted a Bleſſing in our World, as a long Life, a peaceable Death, and an Honourable Burial, ſhould paſs here for an exemplary Puniſhment. What, do you take a Burial, for a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing then, replyed that Man? And, in good earneſt, can you conceive any thing more Horrid, than a Corps crawling with Worms, at the diſcretion of Toads, which feed on his Cheeks; the Plague it ſelf Clothed with the Body of a Man? Good God! The very thought of having, even when I am Dead, my Face wrapt up in a Shroud, and a Pike-depth of Earth upon my Mouth, makes me I can hardly fetch breath. The Wretch whom you ſee carried here, beſides the diſgrace of being thrown into a Pit, hath been Condemned, to be attended by an Hundred and Fifty
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57769:65"/> of his Friends; who are ſtrictly charged, as a Puniſhment for their having loved an envious and ungrateful Perſon, to appear with a ſad Countenance at his Funeral; and had it not been that the Judges took ſome compaſſion of him, imputing his Crimes partly to his want of Wit, they would have been commanded to Weep there alſo. All are Burnt here, except Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors: And, indeed, it is a moſt ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and decent Cuſtom: For we believe, that the Fire having ſeparated the pure from the impure, the Heat by Sympathy reaſſembles the natural Heat, which made the Soul, and gives it force to mount up, till it arrive at ſome Star, the Country of certain people, more immaterial and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual than us; becauſe their Temper ought to ſuit with, and participate of the Globe which they inhabit.</p>
                  <p>However, this is not our neateſt way of Burying neither; for when any one of our Philoſophers comes to an Age, wherein he finds his Wit begin to decay, and the Ice of his years, to numm the Motions of his Soul, he invites all his Friends to a ſumptuous Banquet; then having declared to them the Reaſons, that move him to bid farewel to Nature, and the little hopes he has, of adding any thing more to his worthy Actions, they ſhew him Favour;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57769:65"/> that's to ſay, they ſuffer him to Dye, or otherwiſe are ſevere to him, and command him to Live. When then, by plurality of Voices, they have put his Life into his own Hands, he acquaints his deareſt Friends with the day and place. Theſe purge, and for Four and Twenty hours abſtain from Eating; then being come to the Houſe of the Sage, and having Sacrificed to the Sun, they enter the Chamber, where the generous Philoſopher waits for them on a Bed of State; every one embraces him, and when it comes to his turn, whom he loves beſt, having kiſſed him affectionately, leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Boſom, and joyning Mouth to Mouth, with his right hand he ſheaths a Dagger in his Heart. The Loving Friend parts not his Lips from his Friends Lips, till he find him expired; and then pulling out the Steel, and putting his Mouth cloſe to the Wound, he ſucks down his Blood, till a Second ſucceed him, then a Third, Fourth, and ſo all the Company: Four or Five Hours after, every one has a Young Wench, of Sixteen or Seventeen Years of Age, brought to him; and during Three or Four days, whilſt they are taſting the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Love, they ſeed on nothing but the Fleſh of the Deceaſed, which they eat raw; to the end that if from an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Embracements any thing Spring,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57769:66"/> they may be aſſured it is their old Friend Revived.</p>
                  <p>I interrupted this Diſcourſe, ſaying to him that told me all, That this Manner of Acting much reſembled the ways of ſome People of our World; and ſo purſued my Walk, which was ſo long, that when I came back, Dinner had been ready Two Hours. They asked me, why I came ſo late? It is not my Fault, ſaid I to the Cook, who complained: I asked what it was a Clock ſeveral times in the Street, but they made me no anſwer, but by opening their Mouths, ſhutting their Teeth, and turning their Faces awry.</p>
                  <p>How, cried all the Company, did not you know by that, that they ſhewed you what it was a Clock? Faith, ſaid I, they might have held their great Noſes in the Sun long enough, before I had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what they meant. It's a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, ſaid they, that ſaves them the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a Watch; for with their Teeth they make ſo true a Dial, that when they would tell any Body the Hour of the day, they do no more but open their Lips, and the ſhadow of that Noſe, falling upon their Teeth, like the Gnomon of a Sun-Dial, makes the preciſe time. Now that you may know the reaſon, why all People in this Country have great Noſes; aſſoon as a Woman is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57769:66"/> brought to Bed, the Midwife carries the Child to the
<hi>Maſter of the Seminary;</hi> and exactly at the years end, the Skillful being aſſembled, if his Noſe prove ſhorter than the ſtanding Meaſure, which an Alderman keeps, he is judged to be a <hi>Flat Noſe,</hi> and delivered over to be gelt. You'l ask me, no doubt, the Reaſon of that Barbarous Cuſtom, and how it comes to paſs, that we, amongſt whom Virginity is a Crime, ſhould enjoyn Continence by force; but know, that we do ſo, becauſe after Thirty Ages expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience we have obſerved, that a great Noſe is the mark of a Witty, Courteous, Aſſable, Generous and Liberal Man; and that a little Noſe is a Sign of the contrary: Wherefore of <hi>Flat Noſes</hi> we make Eunuchs, becauſe the Republick had rather have no Children at all, than Children like them. He was ſtill a ſpeaking, when I ſaw a man come in ſtark Naked; I preſently ſat down and put on my Hat to ſhew him Honour, for theſe are the greateſt Marks of Reſpect, that can be ſhew'd to any in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The Kingdom, ſaid he, deſires you would give the Magiſtrates notice, before you return to your own World; becauſe a Mathematician hath juſt now undertaken before the Council, that provided when you are returned home, you would make a certain Machine, that he'l teach you how
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57769:67"/> to do; he'l attract your Globe, and joyn it to this. Good now, (ſaid I to my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, when the other was gone) tell me why that Meſſenger carried at his Girdle, Privy Members of Braſs; a thing I have often ſeen, whilſt I was in my Cage, but durſt not ask the Reaſon, becauſe I was always environed by the Queens Maids of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, whom I feared to offend, if in their preſence I had talked of ſuch a foul Subject? He made me this anſwer: The Females here, no more than the Males, are not ſo ungrateful, as to bluſh at the ſight of that which Forged them; and Virgins are not aſhamed to love upon us, in Memory of Mother Nature, the only thing that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents her beſt. Know then, that the Scarf wherewith that Man is Honoured, and which for a Medal has the Bauble of a Man hanging at it, is the Badg of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and the Mark to diſtinguiſh the Cavalier from the Clown. This ſeemed to me, to be ſo extravagant a Paradox, that I could not forbear Laughing. I look upon that, replyed I, to be a very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Cuſtom, for in our World, to wear a Sword is the Badg of a Gentleman. But, my dear little Man, cried my Hoſt without ſtartling, what, are the great Men of your World Mad then; to make oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57769:67"/> of an Inſtrument, that's the mark of a Hang man, made only to deſtroy us; and in a word, the ſworn Enemy of all that has Life? And on the contrary, to hide a Member, without which, we had been ranked among the things that are not; the <hi>Prometheus</hi> of every Animal, and the indefatigable Repairer of the Frailties of Nature? Unhappy Country! where the Marks of Generation are Ignominious, and thoſe of Deſtruction Honourable: In the mean time, you call that Member the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Privy-Parts, as if any thing were more Glorious, than to give Life, or any thing more diſgraceful, than to take it away. During all this Diſcourſe, we went on with our Dinner; and as ſoon as we roſe from Table, we went to take the Air in the Garden; where taking Occaſion to ſpeak of the Generation, and Conception of things, he ſaid to me, You muſt know, that the Earth, converting it ſelf into a Tree, from a Tree into a Hog, and from a Hog into a Man, is an Argument, that all things in Nature, aſpire to be Men; ſince that is the moſt perfect Being, as being a Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and the beſt deviſed Mixture in the World; which alone unites the Animal and Rational Life into one. None but a Pedant will deny me this, when we ſee that a Plumb-Tree, by the Heat of its Germ,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57769:68"/> as by a Mouth, ſucks in and digeſts the Earth that's about it; that a Hog devours the Fruit of this Tree, and converts it into the Subſtance of it ſelf; and that a Man feeding on that Hog, reconcocts that dead Fleſh, unites it to himſelf, and makes that Animal to revive under a more Noble Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. So the Man whom you ſee, perhaps threeſcore years ago, was no more but a Tuft of Graſs in my Garden; which is the more probable, that the Opinion of the <hi>Pythagorean Metamorphoſis,</hi> which ſo many Great Men maintain, in all likelyhood has only reached us, to engage us into an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after the truth of it; as, in reality, we have found that Matter, and all that has a Vegetative or Senſitive Life, when once it hath attained to the period of its Perfection, wheels about again, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends into its Inanity, that it may return upon the Stage, and Act the ſame Parts over and over. I went down extreamly ſatisfyed to the Garden, and was beginning to rehearſe to my Companion, what our Maſter had taught me; when the Phyſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomiſt came to conduct us to Supper, and afterwards to Reſt.</p>
                  <p>Next Morning, ſo ſoon as I awoke, I went to call up my Antagoniſt. It is, ſaid I, accoſting him, as great a Miracle to find a great Wit, like yours, buried in Sleep, as
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57769:68"/> to ſee Fire, without Heat and Action: He bore with this ugly Compliment; but, (cryed he, with a Cholerick kind of Love) will you never leave theſe Fabulous Terms? Know, that theſe Names defame the Name of a Philoſopher; and that ſeeing the wiſe Man ſees nothing in the World, but what he conceives, and judges may be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he ought to abhor all thoſe Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Prodigies, and extraordinary Events of Nature, which Block heads have invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to excuſe the Weakneſs of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                  <p>I thought my ſelf then obliged in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to endeavour to undeceive him; and therefore, ſaid I, though you be very ſtiff and obſtinate in your Opinions, yet I have plainly ſeen ſupernatural Things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Say you ſo, continued he; you lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle know, that the force of Imagination, is able to cure all the Diſeaſes, which you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to ſupernatural Cauſes, by reaſon of a certain natural Balſam, that contains Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities quite contrary to the qualities of the Diſeaſes that attack us; which happens, when our Imagination informed by Pain, ſearches in that place for the ſpecifick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, which it applies to the Poiſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. That's the reaſon, why an able Phyſician <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> your World, adviſes the Patient to make uſe of an Ignorant Doctor, whom he eſteems
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57769:69"/> to be very knowing, rather than of a very Skilful Phyſician, whom he may imagine to be Ignorant; becauſe he fancies, that our Imagination labouring to recover our Health, provided it be aſſiſted by Remedies, is able to cure us; but that the ſtrongeſt Medicines are too weak, when not applied by Imagination. Do you think it ſtrange, that the firſt Men of your World lived ſo many Ages, without the leaſt Knowledge of Phyſick? No. And what might have been the Cauſe of that, in your judgement; unleſs, their Nature was as yet in its force, and that natural Balſam in vigour, before they were ſpoilt by the Drugs, wherewith Phyſicians conſume you; it being enough then for the recovery of ones Health, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to wiſh for it, and to imagine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cured? So that their vigorous Fancies, plunging into that vital Oyl, extracted the Elixir of it, and applying Actives to Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives, in almoſt the twinkling of an Eye, they found themſelves as ſound as before: Which, notwithſtanding the Depravation of Nature, happens even at this day, though ſomewhat rarely; and is by the Multitude called a Miracle: For my part, I believe not a jot on't, and have this to ſay for my ſelf, that it is eaſier for all theſe Doctors to be miſtaken, than that the other may not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to paſs: For I put the Queſtion to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57769:69"/> them; A Patient recovered out of a Feaver, heartily deſired, during his ſickneſs, as it is like, that he might be cured, and, may be, made Vows for that effect; ſo that of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity he muſt either have dyed, continued ſick, or recovered: Had he died, then would it have been ſaid, kind Heaven hath put an end to his Pains; Nay, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Prayers, he was now cured of all Diſeaſes, praiſed be the Lord: Had his Sickneſs continued, one would have ſaid, he wanted Faith; but becauſe he is cured, it's a Miracle forſooth. Is it not far more likely, that his Fancy being excited by violent Deſires, hath done its Duty, and wrought the Cure? For grant he hath eſcaped, what then? muſt it needs be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle? How many have we ſeen, pray, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many ſolemn Vows and Proteſtations, go to pot with all their fair Promiſes and Reſolutions.</p>
                  <p>But, at leaſt, replied I, to him, if what you ſay of that Balſam be true, it is a mark of the Rationality of our Soul; ſeeing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of our Reaſon, or the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of our Will, ſhe Acts of her ſelf; as if being without us, ſhe applied the Active to the Paſſive. Now, if being ſeparated from us ſhe is Rational, it neceſſarily follows, that ſhe is Spiritual; and if you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge her to be Spiritual, I conclude ſhe is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57769:70"/> immortal; ſeeing Death happens to Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, only by the changing of Forms, of which Matter alone is capable. The Young Man at that, decently ſitting down upon his Bed, and making me alſo to ſit, diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as I remember, in this manner: As for the Soul of Beaſts, which is Corporeal, I do not wonder they Die; ſeeing the beſt Harmony of the four Qualities may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, the greateſt force of Blood quelled, and the lovelieſt Proportion of Organs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted; but I wonder very much, that our intellectual, incorporeal, and immortal Soul, ſhould be conſtrained to diſlodge, and leave us by the ſame Cauſe, that makes an Ox to periſh. Hath ſhe covenanted with our Body, that as ſoon as he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a prick with a Sword in the Heart, a Bullet in the Brain, or a Musket-ſhot through the Cheſt, ſhe ſhould pack up and be gone;—and if that Soul were Spiritual, and of her ſelf ſo Rational, that being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from our Maſs, ſhe underſtood as well as when Clothed with a Body; why cannot Blind Men, born with all the fair ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of that intellectual Soul, imagine what it is to ſee? Is it, becauſe they are not as yet deprived of Sight, by the Death of all their Senſes? How! I cannot then make uſe of my Right Hand, becauſe I have a Left.—And in fine, to make a juſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57769:70"/> compariſon, which will overthrow all that you have ſaid; I ſhall only alledge to you a Painter, who cannot work without his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil: And I'll tell you, that it is juſt ſo with the Soul, when ſhe wants the uſe of the Senſes. O yes, but added he—In the mean time, they'l have this Soul, which can only act imperfectly, becauſe of the loſs of one of her Tools, in the courſe of Life, to be able then to work to Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when after our death, ſhe hath loſt them all. If they tell me, over and over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that ſhe needeth not theſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for performing her Functions, I'll tell them e'en ſo, That then all the Blind about the Streets, ought to be Whipt at a Carts-Arſe, for playing the Counterfeits, in pretending not to See a bit. He would have gone on in ſuch impertinent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, had not I ſtopt his Mouth, by deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to forbear, as he did for fear of a quarrel; for he perceived I began to be in a heat: So that he departed, and left me admiring the People of that World, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom even the meaneſt have Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſo much Wit; whereas thoſe of ours have ſo little, and yet ſo dearly bought. At length my Love for my Country, took me off of the deſire and thoughts I had of ſtaying there, I minded nothing now but to be gone; but I ſaw ſo much impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57769:71"/> in the matter, that it made me quite peeviſh and melancholick. My Spirit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it, and having asked me, What was the reaſon, that my Humor was ſo much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered? I frankly told him the Cauſe of my Melancholy; but he made me ſuch fair Promiſes concerning my Return, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied wholly upon him. I acquainted the Council with my deſign; who ſent for me, and made me take an Oath, that I ſhould relate in our World, all that I had ſeen in that. My Paſs ports then were expeded, and my Spirit having made neceſſary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for ſo long a Voyage, asked me, What part of my Country I deſired to light in? I told him, that ſince moſt of the Rich Youths of <hi>Paris,</hi> once in their life time, made a Journey to
<hi>Rome;</hi> imagining atter that, that there remained no more worth the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſeeing, I prayed him to be ſo good as to let me imitate them: But withal, ſaid I, in what Machine ſhall we perform the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and what Orders do you think the Mathematician, who talked t'other day of joyning this Globe to ours, will give me? As to the Mathematician, ſaid he, let that be no hinderance to you; for he is a Man who promiſes much, and performs little or nothing. And as to the Machine, that's to carry you back, it ſhall be the ſame which brought you to Court. How, ſaid I, will
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57769:71"/> the Air become as ſolid as the Earth, to bear your ſteps? I cannot believe that: And it is ſtrange, replied he, that you ſhould believe, and not believe. Pray why ſhould the Witches of your World, who march in the Air, and conduct whole Armies of Hail, Snow, Rain, and other Meteors, from one Province into another, have more Power than we? Pray have a little better opinion of me, than to think I would impoſe upon you. The truth is, ſaid I, I have received ſo many good Offices from you, as well as
<hi>Socrates,</hi> and the reſt, for whom you have ſo great kindneſs, that I dare truſt my ſelf in your hands, as now I do, reſigning my ſelf heartily up to you. I had no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſaid the word, but he roſe like a Whirl-wind, and holding me between his Arms, without the leaſt Uneaſineſs, he made me paſs that vaſt ſpace, which Aſtronomers reckon betwixt the Moon and us, in a day and a halfs time; which convinced me, that they tell a Lye, who ſay that a Mill-ſtone would be Three Hundred Threeſcore, and I know not how many years more, in falling from Heaven, ſince I was ſo ſhort a while, in dropping down from the Globe of the Moon upon this. At length, about the beginning of the Second day, I perceived I
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57769:72"/> was drawing near our World; ſince I could already diſtinguiſh <hi>Europe</hi> from <hi>Africa,</hi> and both from
<hi>Aſia,</hi> when I ſmelt Brimſtone, which I ſaw ſteaming out of a very high Mountain, that incommoded me ſo much that I fainted away upon it. I cannot tell what befel me afterwards; but coming to my ſelf again, I found I was amongſt Briers on the ſide of a Hill, amidſt ſome Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, who ſpake <hi>Italian.</hi> I knew not what was become of my Spirit, and I ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Shepherds if they had not ſeen him. At that word they made the ſign of the Croſs, and looked upon me, as if I had been a Devil my ſelf: But when I told them that I was a Chriſtian, and that I begg'd the Charity of them, that they would lead me to ſome place, where I might take a little reſt; they conducted me into a Village, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Mile off; where no ſooner was I come, but all the Dogs of the place, from the leaſt Cur, to the biggeſt Maſtiff, flew upon me, and had torn me to pieces, if I had not found a Houſe, wherein I ſaved my ſelf: But that hindered them not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their Barking and Bawling, ſo that the Maſter of the Houſe began to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me with an Evil Eye; and really I think, as people are very apprehenſive, when Accidents which they look upon to be ominous happen, that man could have
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57769:72"/> delivered me up as a Prey to theſe accurſed Beaſts, had not I be thought my ſelf, that that which madded them ſo much at me, was the World from whence I came; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being accuſtomed to bark at the Moon, they ſmelt I was come from thence, by the ſcent of my Cloaths, which ſtuck to me, as a Sea-ſmell hangs about thoſe, who have been long on Ship-board, for ſometime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they come aſhore. To Air my ſelf then, I lay three or four hours in the Sun, upon a Terraſs-walk; and being afterwards come down, the Dogs, who ſmelt no more that influence which had made me their Enemy, left barking, and peaceably went to their ſeveral homes. Next day I parted for <hi>Rome,</hi> where I ſaw the ruins of the Triumphs of ſome great Men, as well as of Ages: I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired thoſe lovely Relicks; and the Repairs of ſome of them made by the Modern. At length, having ſtayed there a fortnight in Company of <hi>Monſieur de Cyrano</hi> my Couſin, who advanced me Money for my Return, I went to <hi>Civita vecchia,</hi> and embarked in a Galley that carried me to <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all this Voyage, my mind run upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the Wonders of the laſt I made. At that time I began the Memoires of it; and after my return, put them into as good order, as Sickneſs, which confines me to Bed, would permit. But foreſeeing, that it will
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57769:73"/> put an end to all my Studies, and Travels; that I may be as good as my word to the Council of that World; I have begg'd of <hi>Monſieur le Bret,</hi> my deareſt and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Friend, that he would publiſh them, with the Hiſtory of the <hi>Republick of the Sun,</hi> that of the <hi>Spark,</hi> and ſome other Pieces of my Compoſing, if thoſe who have Stolen them from us, reſtore them to him, as I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly adjure them to do.</p>

                  <div type="section">
                     <p>OUR Ship at length arrived in the Harbour of
<hi>Toulon,</hi> where the Paſſengers being immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put aſhore, and having thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Winds and Stars, for the Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Voyage, we mutually embrac'd, and took our leave one of another. For my part, ſeeing in the World of the Moon, whence I came, a Song goes for Money, no that I had quite forgot the uſe of it; the huneſt Maſter thought himſelf ſufficiently
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57769:76"/> paid for my paſſage, by the Honour he had of carrying on Board a Man who had dropt from Heaven: So that nothing hindred our Progreſs to a Friends Houſe of mine near <hi>Thoulouſe.</hi> I was impatient of ſeeing him, in hopes that I might fill him with Joy, by the Relation of my Adventures. I ſhall not trouble you with an account of all that happened to me upon the Road; I tired my ſelf, and took reſt; I felt hunger and thirſt, and drank and eat amidſt a Pack of twenty or thirty Hounds, that belonged to him. Though I was much disfigured, lean and Sun-burnt, he knew me for all that; being tranſported with Joy, he flew about my Neck, and having in an Extaſie of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent kiſſed me above an hundred times, he pulled me into his Houſe, where ſo ſoon as Tears had given way to Words: We live now, at length, cried he, and ſhall live, in ſpight of all the Accidents, wherewith Fortune hath toſſed our Life. But, Good God! It was a falſe report then, that you were burnt in <hi>Canada,</hi> in that great Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, whereof you were the Inventor? And nevertheleſs, two or three Perſons of Credit, amongſt thoſe who brought me the ſad Tidings, ſwore to me that they had ſeen and touched that Bird of Wood, wherein you were hurried away. They told me, that it was your Misfortune to go into it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57769:76"/> at the very inſtant they put Fire to it; and that the rapid Force of the Squibs, that burnt all round it, carried you ſo high, that the Spectators loſt ſight of you: So that, as they proteſted, you were to that degree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, that the Machine falling down again, very little of your Aſhes were to befound. Theſe Aſhes. Sir, then, anſwered I, were the Aſhes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Machine it ſelf; for the Fire did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> hurt. The Fire-works were faſtened on the outſide, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence their Heat would not incommode me.</p>
                     <p>Now you muſt know, that ſo ſoon as the Salt-peter was ſpent, the impetuous force of the Fire-works being no longer able to bear up the Machine, it fell to the Ground. I ſaw it fall; and when I thought to have tumbled down head-long with it, I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much ſurprized to find, that I mounted up towards the Moon. But I muſt explain to you the Cauſe of an effect, which you may look upon as a Miracle.</p>
                     <p>The Day when that Accident happened, I had, becauſe of ſome bruiſes, rubbed my Body all over with Marrow: Now the Moon being then in the Wain, at which time ſhe attracts Marrow, ſhe ſuckt up ſo greedily that wherewith I had anointed my Fleſh, eſpecially when my box was got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the middle Region, where no Clouds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57769:77"/> to weaken her Influence, that my Body followed the Attraction; and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſhe continued to ſuck me up ſo long, that at length I arrived at that World, which here they call the Moon.</p>
                     <p>Then I told him in full all the particulars of my Voyage, and <hi>Monſieur de Colignac,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed to hear things ſo extraordinary, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured me to put them in Writing. I, who love Repoſe, declined it as long as I could, by reaſon of the viſits that ſuch a Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all probability world procure me; but being out of Countenance at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, wherewith he conſtantly baited me, that I made ſlight of his Entreaties; I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at length to give him that ſatisfaction. I put Pen to Paper then, and he being more impatiently tickled with my glory, than his own; no ſooner had I made an end of a Sheet, but he haſtened with it to
<hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> there to give it vent in the moſt ingenious Aſſemblies. Seeing he had the Reputation of one of the wittieſt Men of the Age, my Praiſes, of which he was the indefatigable Herald, made me known of all Men. The Engravers, without ever having ſeen me, had already engraven my Picture; and the Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers ſtunned the whole City, crying about the Streets till they were hoarſe again, <hi>Who'll buy the Picture of the Author of the States and Empires of the Moon.</hi> Amongſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57769:77"/> thoſe who read my Book, there were a great many Ignorants that were likewiſe medling. Theſe that they might act the Wits of the higheſt flight, applauded as others did, clapt at every Word, for fear of being miſtaken, and raviſhed with delight, cry'd, It's good! even where they underſtood not a tittle: But Superſtition diſguized into Remorſe, which hath very ſharp Teeth under a Fool's Coat, ſo knaw'd the Heart of them, that they choſe rather to renounce the Reputation of a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, which, indeed, was a Habit that did not at all become them, than to anſwer for it at the day of Judgment.</p>
                     <p>Here, then, is the Reverſe of the Medal, he's the beſt Man now that can retract firſt. The work they had ſo much eſteemed, is no more now but a Hodge-podge of ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Tales, a heap of incoherent Shreds, a Fardel of idle ſtories, to wheadle young Children to Bed with; and ſome who hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood the Grammar of it, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Author to
<hi>Bedlam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This claſhing of Opinions betwixt the Wiſe-men and Fools, encreaſed its Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Shortly afterwards Manuſcript-copies of it were ſold privately; all the World, and what is out of the World alſo, that's to ſay, all from the Gentleman to the Monk, brought up the piece: nay, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57769:78"/> came in for a ſhare too; every Family was divided, and the Intereſts of that quarrel went ſo far, that the whole City broke into two, the <hi>Lunar</hi> and <hi>Antilunar</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p>Thus was the War carried on by Skirmiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, when one Morning I perceived nine or ten Beards of the long Robe enter
<hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignac</hi>'s Chamber, who preſently ſpoke to him to this purpoſe.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Sir, you know that there is not one of us here, who is not your Allie, Kinſman or Friend, and that by conſequence no Diſgrace can befal you, but what muſt reflect upon us: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs we are informed from good hands, that you entertain a Sorcerer in your Houſe: A Sorcerer, cried <hi>Colignac?</hi> Good God! Name him to me, and I'll deliver him up into your Hands; but you muſt have a care it be not a Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. How, Sir, ſaid one of the moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable, interrupting him, is there any Parliament more skilled in Wizards than ours? In a word, Dear Nephew, that we may hold you no longer in ſuſpence, the Sorcerer whom we accuſe, is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>of the States and Empires of the Moon:</hi> He cannot deny, having confeſſed what he has done, but that he is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Magician in <hi>Europe.</hi> How is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to mount up to the Moon, without the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57769:78"/> help of—? I dare not name the Beaſt; for in ſhort, tell me, what went he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to do in the Moon? A pretty queſtion, ſaid another interrupting; he went to be preſent at a meeting that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly was kept there that day: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, you ſee he was acquainted with the Demon of <hi>Socrates.</hi> Are you ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed then, that the Devil, as he ſaith, brought him back again into this World? But however it be, look ye, ſo many Moons, ſo many Progreſſes and Voyages through the Air, are good for nothing; I ſay nothing at all; and betwixt you and me, (at theſe words he put his Mouth to the others Ear) I never knew a Sorcerer but had Commerce with the Moon.</q> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe good Counſels they held their peace; and <hi>Colignac</hi> ſtood ſo amazed at their Common Extravagance, that he could not ſpeak one word: Which a grave Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, who had ſaid nothing as yet, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Look you, ſays he, Couſin, we know where the matter pinches; the Magician is a perſon whom you love, but be not ſtartled, for your ſake favour ſhall be ſhewn him; only deliver him fairly over to us, and in conſideration of you we engage our Honour, to have him burnt without Scandal.</q>

                        <hi>Colignac,</hi> at theſe words, though he held his ſides, could not hold, but burſt out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fit of Laughter, which did not a little offend the Gentlemen his Kinſmen; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he had no power to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to any point of their Harangue, but by haaaa's or hoooo's; which ſo ſcandalized his worthy Relations, that they departed with ſhame enough to carry back with them to <hi>Thoulouſe.</hi> When they were gone, I drew <hi>Colignac</hi> into his Cloſet, where ſo ſoon as I had ſhut the Door, Count, ſaid I, to him, Theſe long-bearded Ambaſſadours I don't like, they ſeem to me to be blazing Stars; I'm afraid the noiſe they have made, may be the clap of the Thunder-bolt that's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall. Though their Accuſation be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, and, perhaps, an effect of their Stupidity: yet I ſhall be no leſs a dead Man, though a dozen Men of Senſe, who may ſee me roaſted, ſhould ſay that my Judges are Sots; all the Arguments they might uſe to prove my Innocence would not bring me to life again; and my Aſhes would be every jot as cold in a Grave, as in the open Air. And therefore, with Submiſſion to your better Judgment, I ſhould joyfully conſent to a Temptation which ſuggeſts to me, not to leave them any thing in this Province but my Picture: For it would make me ſtark-ſtaring mad, to die for a thing which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57769:79"/> I don't believe. <hi>Colignac</hi> had hardly the Patience to hear me out. However, at firſt he did but railly me; but when he ſaw that I was in earneſt: Ha! s'death, cried he, before they touch a hair of your Head, I my ſelf, my Friends, Vaſſals, and all that reſpect me, ſhall periſh firſt. My Houſe cannot be Fired without Cannon; it ſtands advantagiouſly, and is well flanked: But I'm a Fool, continued he, to caution my ſelf againſt the thunder of Parchment: It's ſometimes more to be feared, replied I, than the Thunder of the ſecond Region of the Air.</p>
                     <p>From that time forward we talked of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but diverting our ſelves. One day we hunted, another we walkt and took the Air; ſometimes we received Viſits, and ſometimes we rendred them: In a word we always changed our Recreations, before they became tireſome.</p>
                     <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Cuſſan,</hi> a Man who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the World, was commonly with us, and we with him; and to render the places of our abode the more agreeable by viciſſitude, we went from
<hi>Colignac</hi> to <hi>Cuſſan,</hi> and returned from <hi>Cuſſan</hi> to <hi>Colignac.</hi> The innocent Pleaſures which refreſh the Body, made but the leaſt part of ours. We want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none of thoſe that the mind can find in Study and Converſation; and our Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57769:80"/> uniting like our minds, brought all the Learned into our Society. We mingled reading with Converſation; Converſation with good Cheer, that with Fiſhing, Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Walking; and in a word, I may ſay, we injoyed our ſelves, and whatever Nature hath produced for the Pleaſure of Life, and uſed our Reaſon only to limit our Deſires. In the mean time, to the prejudice of my repoſe, my Reputation ſpread it ſelf in the Neighbouring Villages, nay and in the Towns and Cities of the Province; all Men being invited by the current Report, made a pretext of coming to ſee the Lord, that they might ſee the Sorcerer. When I went abroad, not only Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but the Men alſo ſtared at me, as if I had been the Beaſt. Eſpecially, the Paſtor of <hi>Colignac,</hi> who, whether out of Malice or Ignorance, was in ſecret my greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. That Man being in appearance ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and of a low and plain Spirit, which made him very pleaſant in a kind of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bluntneſs, was in reality a very wicked Fellow: He was revengeful even to Fury; a Backbitter ſomewhat more than a <hi>Norman;</hi> and ſo great a Barretter, that the love of Wrangling and going to law was his predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Paſſion. Having been a long time at Law with his Lord, whom he hated the more, as that he had found him firm againſt all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57769:80"/> his Attacks, he feared his Reſentment, and that he might avoid it, had offered to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change his Living: But whether he had changed his Deſign, or had only deſerred it to be revenged on <hi>Colignac</hi> in my Perſon, during the time that he continued in his place, he ſtrove to perſwade the contrary; though the frequent Journeys he made to
<hi>Thoulouſe</hi> gave grounds to ſuſpect it. There he told a Thouſand ridiculous ſtories of my Enchantments; and the Suggeſtions of that malicious Man, concurring with the Voice of the ſimple and ignorant People, made my Name accurſed in that place: They talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no otherwiſe of me than of a new <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa;</hi> and we had Information, that a Proceſs was even commenced againſt me, at the ſuit of the Curate, who had been Tutor to his Children. This we had Notice of from ſeveral Perſons, who concerned themſelves in the Affairs of <hi>Colignac</hi> and the Marqueſs. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the blockiſh Humor of an entire Countrey, was to us a Subject of Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Laughter; nevertheleſs I was ſtartled at it in private, when I more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, the troubleſome Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that ſuch an Error might produce. My good <hi>Genius,</hi> without doubt, gave me the Alarum; it enlightned my Reaſon with theſe noti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>, to let me ſee the Precipice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57769:81"/> which I was ready to tumble; and not thinking it enough thus tacitely to adviſe me, it reſolved to declare more expreſly in my Favors. A moſt troubleſome Night having ſucceeded one of the pleaſanteſt Days that we had ſpent at <hi>Colignac,</hi> I aroſe by Break of Day; and to diſpell the Clouds and Cares, that ſtill dulled and diſcompoſed my Mind, I went into the Garden, where Verdure, Flowers and Fruits, Art and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, charmed the Soul through the Eyes; when at the ſame inſtant I perceived the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, walking by himſelf, with a ſlow Pace, and penſive Countenance, in a large Alley, which divided the Garden into two. I was much ſurpriſed to ſee him, contrary to Cuſtom, ſo early; that made me haſten up to him, that I might ask him the reaſon of it. He made me anſwer, that ſome trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Dreams, wherewith he had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, was the Cauſe, that contrary to Cuſtom, he was come ſo early to cure by Day, an Evil he had contracted in the Night. I confeſſed to him, that a like Misfortune had hindred me from ſleeping, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to tell him the Particulars thereof; but juſt as I was opening my Mouth, we perceived at the Corner of a railed Walk, which croſſed into ours,
<hi>Colignac</hi> coming in great haſte. So ſoon as he ſaw us at a diſtance, Gentlemen, cried he, take here
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57769:81"/> one who hath juſt eſcaped from the moſt dreadful Viſions, that are able to turn the Brains of a mortal Man. I could hardly take time to put on my Doublet, before I came down to give you an account of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; but finding neither of you in your Chambers, I haſtened to the Garden, ſuppoſing you might be there. The Truth is, the poor Gentleman was almoſt out of Breath. So ſoon as he had taken a little Breath, we entreated him to eaſe himſelf of a matter, which, though many times ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlight, nevertheleſs weighs heavy. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to do ſo, replied he; but let's firſt ſit down. An Arbor of Jeſſamine offered us very pat both Seats and Shade: We enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and every one being placed, <hi>Colignae</hi> thus continued: You muſt know, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two or three diſturbed Sleeps, I fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Day-break into a Slumber, wherein I dream'd, that my dear Gueſt there, was in the middle, betwixt the Marqueſs and me, and that we embraced him ſtraightly, when a black Monſter, conſiſting wholly of Heads, came all of a ſudden to ſnatch him from us: Nay, I fancy'd, he was about to throw him into a great Fire, kindled hard by; for already he held him ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the Flames: But a Virgin, like one of the Muſes, whom they call
<hi>Euterpe,</hi> fell upon her Knees before a Lady, whom ſhe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57769:82"/> adjured to ſave him (that Lady had the Preſence and Marks which Painters uſe to give in repreſenting of Nature.) Hardly had ſhe heard out the Prayers of her Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-maid, when all amated; Alas! cried ſhe, he is one of our Friends. Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereupon ſhe put to her Mouth a kind of a long Pipe, like a Sackbut, and blew ſo long through it, under the Feet of my dear Gueſt, that ſhe made him mount up to Heaven, and protected him from the Cruelties of the Monſter with an hundred Heads. I fancy'd that I cried a long time after him, and adjur'd him not to be gone without me; when an infinite number of little round Angels, who called themſelves the Children of the Morning, carried me to the ſame Countrey whither he ſeemed to fly, and ſhewed me things which I ſhall not relate, becauſe I look upon them as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous. We beſought him, that he would tell us them however. I imagined my ſelf, continued he, to be in the Sun, and that the Sun was a World. I had been ſtill in the ſame Miſtake, had not the neighing of my Horſe awakned me, and convinced me that I was a Bed. When the Marqueſs perceived that <hi>Colignac</hi> had made an end: Well, then, ſaid he, Monſieur
<hi>Dyrcona,</hi> what was your Dream? As for mine, anſwered I, though it be no vulgar Dream,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57769:82"/> yet I lay no ſtreſs upon it. I am a bilious Melancholick, and that's the reaſon that all my life time I have dreamt of nothing but of Caves and Fire. In the prime of my Youth, I fancied in my Sleep, that I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come light, and took a flight up to the Clouds, that I might avoid the Rage of a Company of Murderers that purſued me; but that after a long and vigorous Attempt, ſome Wall always withſtood me, though I had ſurmounted a great many others, at the Foot whereof, tired out with Strugling and Labour, I never failed to be ſtopt; or otherwiſe, if I imagined that I took my Flight right upwards, though I ſeemed for a long time to have ſwum in the Skies, yet I ſtill found my ſelf near the Earth; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all reaſon, though I thought my ſelf neither weary nor heavy, yet I was ſtill within reach of my Enemies, who ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth their Hands to catch me by the Foot, and pull me to them. Since I knew any thing, I never had any other Dreams but ſuch as this, unleſs laſt night; when having, according to my Cuſtom, flown a long while, and often eſcaped from my Perſecutors, I thought at length, that I loſt fight of them; and that in an open and clear Sky, my Body eaſed of all Heavineſs, I purſued my Voyage into a Palace where Light and Heat are hatched. I had, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57769:83"/> doubt, obſerved a great many other things; but that my Agitation to fly, brought me ſo near the Beds ſide, that I fell upon the Floor on my naked Belly, with Eyes full open. This, Gentlemen, is the ſhort and long of my Dream, which I only look upon as an Effect of thoſe two Qualities, that are predominant in my Conſtitution: for though this be a little different from thoſe which I commonly have, in that I flew up to Heaven without falling back; yet I only aſcribe that Alteration to my Blood, dilated by the Pleaſures of our Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday's Diverſions, which hath diſſipated my Melancholy; and by buoying of it up, cleared it from that Weightineſs which made me tumble down again: But after all, that's a very conjectural Science. I' Faith, continued <hi>Cuſſan,</hi> you are in the right on't, it's a Hodge-podge of all the things we have thought on when awake, a monſtrous Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera, a Muſter of confuſed Idea's, which the Fancy, that during Sleep, is not gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Reaſon, preſents to us, without Order; out of which nevertheleſs we think to ſqueeze the true Meaning, and draw from Dreams, as from Oracles, the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things future; but I vow, I could never find any other Conformity betwixt them; but that Dreams, like Oracles, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underſtood: However, judge of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57769:83"/> the worth of all the reſt, by mine which is not at all extraordinary. I dreamt that I was very ſad, and that I met with
<hi>Dyrcona</hi> in all places, who called for our Aſſiſtance. But without beating my Brains any more, about the Explication of theſe dark Riddles, I'll tell ye their Myſtical Senſe in two Words; and that's, in troth, that our Dreams at <hi>Colignac</hi> are very bad, and that if you'll take my Advice, we'll go and have better at <hi>Cuſſan.</hi> Let's go, then, ſaid the Count to me, ſince this Man is ſo uneaſie here. We reſolved to be gone the ſame day; and I prayed them to ſet out before, becauſe I was willing, ſeeing (as they had agreed upon it) we were to be there a Month, to have ſome Books carried along with me: They condeſcended, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after Break-faſt got on Horſe-back. In the mean time, I packed up ſome Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, which I imagined not to be in the Library of
<hi>Cuſſan,</hi> put them upon a Mule, and about three in the Afternoon ſet out upon a very good Pad. However, I went but a Foot-pace, that I might attend my little Library, and at more leiſure enrich my mind with the Liberalities of my ſight. But liſten to an Adventure, that will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriſe you.</p>
                     <p>I was got forwards on my Journey above four Leagues, when I found my ſelf in a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57769:84"/> Country which I was certain I had ſeen ſomewhere elſe before: The truth is, I ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited my Memory ſo much to tell me, how I came to know that Landskip, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Objects, reviving paſt Images, I remembred that that was exactly the place, which the Night before I had ſeen in a Dream. That odd rencounter would have buſied my thoughts longer than it did, had I not been diverted by a ſtrange Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A Spirit, (at leaſt I took it for one) meeting me in the middle of the way, took hold of my Horſe by the Bridle. This Phantome was of a prodigious Shape, and what I could gueſs by the little I ſaw of his Eyes, had a ſurly and ſtern Look. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, though, whether he was handſome or ugly; for a long Gown made of the Leaves of a Church plain Song-Book, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him to the Fingers-ends, and his Face was hid under a thing like a Horn-Book, wherein was written the <hi>in Principio.</hi> The firſt Words that the Phantome uttered, were with great amazement <hi>Satanus Diabolus, I conjure thee by the Great and Living God,</hi>—at theſe Words he ſtuck, but ſtill repeating the <hi>Great and Living God,</hi> and with a wild and skared Look, caſting about for his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor to blow into him the reſt; when he found, that to what ſide ſoever he looked, his Paſtor was not to be ſeen, he fell into ſuch a dreadful ſhaking Fit, that by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57769:84"/> chattering and diddering, one half of his Teeth dropt out, and two Thirds of the Muſick-notes, under which he lurkt, flew about like Thiſtle Down. He came back, however, towards me, and with a Look that ſeemed neither ſoft nor ſurly, by which I perceived he was in doubt what courſe was beſt for him to take, whether to be rough or mild: O! well then, ſaid he, <hi>Satanus Diabolus, by the Blood I conjure thee in the Name of God, and of Maſs-John, let me do my Buſineſs: For if thou ſtirreſt either Hand or Foot; Devil take—thy Guts are out.</hi> I had a laſh at him with the Bridle Reins; but being almoſt choaked with laughter, I had little ſtrength to do any thing: Beſides that, about half a hundred Country Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, came out from behind a Hedge, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their Knees, and tearing their Throats with <hi>Kyrie Eleiſons.</hi> When they were got near enough, four of the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of the Rout, having firſt plunged their Hands into a Holy Water-pot, which was purpoſely carried by the Prieſt's Man, caught hold of me by the Neck. No ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was I arreſted, but in comes <hi>Maſs John,</hi> who devoutly pulling out his Stole, bound me faſt with it; and preſently after, a flock of Women and Children, who in ſpight of all the Reſiſtance I could make, ſowed me up in a great Sheet; wherein I was ſo dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57769:85"/> ſwadled, that nothing was to be ſeen of me but the Head. In this Equipage they carried me to <hi>Thoulouſe;</hi> as if they had been carrying me to my Grave: By and by cried one, Had not this been done, we ſhould have had a Famine, becauſe, when they met me, I was certainly going to lay a Spell upon the Corn; and then I heard another complaining, that the Scab did not begin amongſt his Sheep, till of a <hi>Sunday,</hi> when the People were coming from <hi>Veſpers,</hi> I clapt him on the Shoulder. But in ſpight of all my Diſaſters, I could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbear to laugh, when I heard a young Country Girl, with a dreadful Tone, cry after her Sweet-heart,
<hi>alias</hi> the Phantome, who had ſeiz'd my Horſe. (For you muſt know, that the Youngſter had got on the Back of him, and ſpurr'd him briskly, as if he had been his own already,) Wretch, bauled out his Duckling, What art blind then? Does n't ſee that the Magician's Horſe is blacker than Coal, and that it is the Devil in Perſon carrying thee away to a meeting of Witches? Our Amorous Clown terrified at that, tumbled backwards over the Beaſts Tail; ſo that my Horſe was ſet at Liberty. They conſulted whether or not they ſhould ſeize my Mule, and agreed in the Affirmative; but having unript the Pack, and at the opening of the firſt Book hitting
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57769:85"/>
                        <hi>Deſcarteſes</hi> Phyſicks, when they ſaw the Circles whereby that Philoſopher diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes the Motions of the ſeveral Planets, all of them with one voice roared out, that they were the Conjuring Lines, I uſed to draw for raiſing of <hi>Beelzebub.</hi> He that held it in his Hands, ſeized with a panick fear, let it fall; and by miſchance, it opened at a Page, where the Virtues of the Load-ſtone are explained: I ſay, by miſchance; becauſe, in the place I ſpeak of, there is a Cut of that Metallick Stone, where the little Bodies, that are let looſe from the whole, to faſten to the Iron, are repreſented like Arms. No ſooner had one of the Raſcals perceived it, but I heard him ſcream out, that that was the Toad which was found in the Manger of his Couſin
<hi>Dick</hi>'s Stable, when his Horſes died. At that Word, they who ſeemed to be in the greateſt heat, clapt their Hands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Boſoms or Pockets. <hi>Maſs John</hi> cried with open Mouth, that they ſhould take ſpecial care not to touch any thing; that all theſe were Books of down-right Conjuring, and the Mule a <hi>Satan.</hi> The Rabble thus frightened, let the Mule depart in Peace. Nevertheleſs, I ſaw <hi>Joan</hi> the Parſon's Maid drive him towards her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Stable, for fear he might get into the Church-yard, and there pollute the Graſs of the departed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:57769:86"/> It was full Seven of the Clock at Night, when we arrived at a Town, where for my Refreſhment I was dragg'd to Goal: For the Reader would not believe me, if I ſaid that they Buried me alive in a Hole: And nevertheleſs it is true, that with one turn I ſurveyed the whole extent of it. In a Word, there was no Body that ſaw me in that place, but would have taken me for a bit of Wax-Candle, lighted under a Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-Glaſs. At firſt, when my Goaler turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me into that Cave: If you give me, ſaid I to him, this Stone Garment for a Doublet, it is too big; but if it be for a Tomb, it's too little. The days here are only to be reckoned by Nights; of my five Senſes, I retain only the uſe of two, Smelling and Feeling; the one, to make me ſenſible of the ſtink of my Priſon; and the other, to render it palpable to me. In reality, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to you, I ſhould think I were damned, if I knew not that no Innocent Perſon goes to Hell.</p>
                     <p>At that word Innocent, the Goaler burſt out into Laughter. Nay, Faith, ſaid he, you are one of our right Birds then, for I never yet kept any under my Key, but ſuch Gentlemen as theſe. After ſome other Compliments of that Nature; the good Man took the pains to ſearch me, I know not on what deſign; but becauſe of the Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57769:86"/> he uſed, I conjecture it was for what I had. The pains he took in ſearching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all in vain, becauſe during the Battel of
<hi>Diabolus,</hi> I had conveyed my Gold into my Stockings; when after a moſt exact A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy, he found his hands as empty as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; both of us were within an Ace of Death, I for fear, and he for grief. S'ounds, cried he, foaming at the Mouth, at firſt ſight I knew he was a Sorcerer, he's as poor as the Devil. Go, go, Comrade, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, mind the Affairs of your Conſcience in time. He had no ſooner ſaid ſo, but that I heard the knell of a bunch of Keys, amongſt which, he lookt for thoſe of my Dungeon. His back was turned; and therefore for fear he might take his revenge for the misfortune of his Viſit, I cunningly pull'd three Piſtoles out of their Neſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, Maſter Houſe-keeper, there's a Piſtole, pray ſend me a bit of ſomewhat, for I have not eat theſe eleven hours paſt. He took it very favorably, and proteſted he was troubled at my Misfortune. When I perceived he was a little mollified; come, here's another, continued I, as an Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Trouble, I am aſhamed to give you: At once he opened his Ear, Heart, and Hand; and I added, making them up three, inſtead of two, that by the third I begg'd of him to let one of his Men come
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57769:87"/> and keep me Company, becauſe the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ought to dread Solitude.</p>
                     <p>Being raviſhed at my Prodigalities, he promiſed me all things, embraced my Legs, railed againſt the Juſtice; told me, that he well perceived I had Enemies, but that I ſhould come off with Honour: that I ſhould take good Heart; and that in the mean time, he engaged himſelf before three days were over, to have my Cuffs waſht for me. I thanked him very ſeriouſly for his Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; and my dear Friend having hung about my Neck, till he had almoſt ſtrangled me, went his way, bolting and double bolting the Door.</p>
                     <p>I remained alone, and very Melancholick, lying round upon a little old Straw, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced almoſt into Duſt. However, it was not yet ſo ſmall, but that above half a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Rats were ſtill a grinding of it. The Vault, Walls, and Floor, were made up of ſix Grave-Stones, that having Death over, under and about me, I might not queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Enterrment. The cold Slime of Snails, and the roapy Venom of Toads, dropt upon my Face; the Fleas there had Teeth longer than their Bodies; I found my ſelf tormented with the Stone, which was not the leſs painful, becauſe it was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. In a word, I fancy that I wanted no more but a Wife, and a Pot-ſheard to make me a real
<hi>Job.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:57769:87"/> I had, however, overcome all the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of two very irkſom Hours, when the noiſe of a Groſs of Keys, with the ratling of the Bolts of my Door, diverted me from minding my Pains. After the jingling noiſe, by a little Lamp-light, I perceived a ſturdy Clown. He unl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ded an earthen Diſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my Legs: And there, there, ſaid he, be not diſturbed, there's a good Cabage Soop for ye; and were it— but indeed it is my Miſtreſs's own Soop; and faith and troth, as the ſaying is, there is not one drop of the Fat taken off on't. Having ſaid ſo, he dives his four Fingers and Thumb to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bottom of the Diſh, to envite me to do the like. I followed my Copy, for fear of diſcouraging him; and he with a joyful glance of an Eye, S'diggers, cried he, you are an honeſt Brother. They zay you've got Ill-willers: S'lid they are Traytors; yes Dad, they are very Traytors: Well, wou'd they'd come here and ſee. Ay, ay, it is ſo; he goes firſt that leads the Dance. This blunt Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity brought a fit of Laughter two or three times up to my very Throat. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I was ſo happy as to check it: I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that Fortune, by means of this Rogue, ſeemed to offer me an occaſion of Liberty; and therefore it extreamly concerned me to gain his Favor; for otherwiſe to eſcape, it was impoſſible. The Architector that built
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57769:88" rendition="simple:additions"/> my Priſon, having made my Entries into it, did not bethink himſelf of making one Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. Theſe Conſiderations were the Cauſe, that to ſound him, I ſpake to him to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, My good Friend, thou art a poor man, is n't that true? Alas! Sir, anſwered the Clown, had you been
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>th the cunning Man, you could not have hit righter. Here then, ſaid I, take that Piſtole.</p>
                     <p>I found his hand to ſhake ſo, when I put the Piſtole into it, that ſcarcely could he ſhut it. That begining ſeemed to me to be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ominous: However, I quickly perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the heartineſs of his Thanks, that he only trembled for Joy; and that made me go on: But wert thou a man, that would be concerned in the accompliſhment of a Vow which I have made, beſides the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy Soul, thou might'ſt be as ſure of twenty Piſtoles, as thou art of thine own Hat: For thou muſt know, that it is not as yet a full quarter of an Hour, in a word, a moment before thou cameſt, that an Angel appeared to me, and promiſed to make the Juſtice of my Cauſe appear, provided I went to morrow to our Lady's Church of this Town, and had a Maſs ſaid at the high Altar there. I pretended to excuſe my ſelf upon the account of my cloſe Impriſonment; but the Angel made Anſwer, That a man ſhould come, ſent from the Goaler, to keep me
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57769:88" rendition="simple:additions"/> company, whom I ſhould but command in his name to carry me to Church, and bring me back again to Priſon; that I ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn him Secreſie, and to obey without gainſaying, upon pain of dying within the Year; and if he queſtioned the Truth of what I ſaid, I ſhould give him this token that he had been touched for the Evil. Now the Reader muſt know, that I had ſeen through a hole of his Shirt, a piece of the King's Gold, which ſuggeſted to me the whole Series of this Apparition. Yea, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily then, ſaid he, good Sir, I ſhall even do what the Angel has commanded me; but it muſt be at nine of the Clock in the Morning, becauſe at that time our Maſter will be at <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> about the making up of a Match betwixt his Son, and the <hi>Maſter of the laſt Work</hi>'s Daughter. D'ye mind me, Sir, the Hangman has a Name, as well as a Crab-louſe: They talk as if ſhe ſhould have from her Father, as many Crowns in Portion, as might make up a King's Ranſom. In ſhort, ſhe is Fair and Rich; but ſuch Wind-falls ſeldom fall in the way of a poor Young-Man. Alaſs! Good Sir, — wou'd have you know—I failed not here to interrupt him; for I foreſaw by the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Digreſſion, that I ſhould be balt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a long tale of a Tub. Our Plot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very cautiouſly laid betwixt us, the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57769:89"/> Clown took leave of me; and failed not next Morning to come at the prefixt hour, and untomb me. I left my Cloaths in the Priſon, and dreſſed my ſelf in Rags; for leaſt I might be known, we had ſo ordered it the Night before. So ſoon as we were abroad in the open Air, I forgot not to tell him down his twenty Piſtoles. He looked and ſtared upon them very wiſtfully. They are good Gold and of full weight, upon my Word, ſaid I to him. Ha, Sir, replied he, that's not the thing I mind; but I'm thinking that <hi>great Ralph</hi>'s Houſe is to be ſold, with a Cloſe and Vineyard. I can have it for two hundred Francks, it will require eight days time to make up the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and I would beg of you, good Sir, if it be your Will and Pleaſure, ſo to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the matter, that till <hi>great Ralph</hi> have told and received your Piſtoles, and lockt them ſafe up in his Cheſt, they may not turn into Shells. I could not but laugh at the ſimplicity of the Knave. In the mean time, we jogg'd on towards the Church, where at length we arrived. Shortly after high Maſs began; but ſo ſoon as I ſaw my Keeper riſe in his turn to go to the offering, I skipped at three leaps out of the Church, and at as many more whipt into a little Bye-Street or Alley. I had a great many thoughts in my head at that inſtant; but that which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57769:89"/> I followed was to get to <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> which was but half a League diſtant from the place, with Deſign to take Poſt there. I got to the Suburbs in very good time; but I was ſo aſhamed to be ſtared at by all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ſaw me, that I was quite out of Countenance: That which made them ſtare, was my Dreſs; for I being but a Novice in the begging Trade, had marſhall'd my Clouts about me ſo odly, that with a Gate that ſuted not at all with my Habit, I ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be one in Diſguiſe, rather than a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; beſides that, I made great haſte, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down, and asked nothing. At length, conſidering that this general Obſervation of the People threatned me with ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Iſſue, I overcame my Baſhfulneſs. So ſoon as I perceived any one that lookt at me, I ſtretched him out my Hand: Nay, I even importuned the Charity of thoſe that did not in the leaſt mind me. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect a little, and wonder how many times by uſing too great Circumſpection, about the Deſigns wherein Fortune will have ſome ſhare, we ſpoil them by provoking that haughty Goddeſs. I make this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, upon Occaſion of the Accident that befel me; for perceiving a Man in the Dreſs of an ordinary Citizen, with his Back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, Sir, ſaid I, pulling him by the Cloak, if there be any Bowels of pity—
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57769:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> I had not brought forth the word that was to come next, when the Man turned about his Head. Good God! What was he? Nay, Good God! What was I? That very Man was my Goaler; we ſtood both ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with Admiration to ſee one another in the place we did. His Eyes were wholly fixed on me, and I had nothing in view but him. In fine, a common Intereſt, though very different, recovered us out of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie wherein both of us were plunged. Ha! Wretch that I am, cried the Goaler, muſt I then be catcht? That Word of a double meaning put into my mind the Stratagem you ſhall hear. Stop Thief, Gentlemen, ſtop Thief, cried I, as loud as I could baul: This Rogue hath ſtole the Jewels of the Counteſs of <hi>Mouſeaux;</hi> I have been a year in ſearch of him. Gentlemen, continued I, all in a heat, a hundred Piſtoles for him that ſhall take him. No ſooner had I let fly theſe Words, but a Troop of the Rabble fell upon the poor amaz'd Wretch. The Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize that my impudence had caſt him into, being heightened by the Imagination he had, that without a Body, like unto that of the Saints in Glory, which might paſs entire through the Walls of my Dungeon, I could not have made my eſcape, ſo tranſported him, that he was for a long time beſides himſelf. He came to himſelf again, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57769:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> at length; and the firſt Words he uſed to undeceive the Mobile, were, That they ſhould have a care they did not commit a miſtake; that he was a man of Honour and Reputation. Without doubt he was about to diſcover the whole Myſtery: But a dozen of Coſter-mongers, Lackeys and Chair-men, being deſirous to ſerve me for my Money, ſtopt his Mouth with Fiſty-cuffs; and in as much as they fancied, that their <hi>Reward</hi> ſhould be proportioned to the degree of Inſolence, wherewith they inſulted over the Weakneſs of the poor ſtunn'd Man, every one came running in to have a touch at him, either with Hand or Foot. Here's your Man of Honour, cried the Riff-raff, and yet he could not forbear to ſay, ſo ſoon as he knew the Gentleman, that he was catcht. The Cream of the Jeſt was, that my Goaler being in his Holy-days Cloaths, was aſhamed to confeſs himſelf to be the Hang-man's Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warden; nay, he was afraid that by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering himſelf to be what he was, he might but encreaſe the number of his Blows. For my own part, whilſt the ſcuffle was at the length I took my flight. I truſted my ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to my Legs, which would have ſoon ſet me at Liberty: But as the Devil would have it, the People beginning of new all to ſtare at me, I found my ſelf in as bad a pickle again as at firſt. If the Spectacle
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57769:91" rendition="simple:additions"/> of an hundred Rags, which like a Brawl of little Beggars danced about me, did excite the Curiofity of any gaping Lout to ſtare at me; I was afraid that he might read in my Fore-head, that I was one that had broken Priſon. If any one paſſing by me, put his Hand out under his Cloak, I fancy'd him to be a Serjeant, who ſtretched out his Arm to lay hold on me. If I obſerved ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcampering along the Streets, without caſting an Eye on me, I perſwaded my ſelf that he feigned not to ſee me, to the end he might ſnap me behind. If I perceived a Shop-keeper enter his Shop, now, ſaid I, he is gone to fetch out his Conſtables Staff. If I came into a place where there was any extraordinary Concourſe of People, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men, thought I, could not be got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there without ſome Deſign. If ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place was empty, here they lye in wait for me. Did I meet with a ſtop, now, thought I, they have barocado'd the Streets to ſhut me in. In a word, Fear perverting my Reaſon, every Man ſeem'd to me to be an Officer, every Word, Stop, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry noiſe, the inſupportable Rattling of the Bolts of my laſt Priſon. Being thus beſet with panick Fear, I reſolved to play the Beggar again, that ſo I might paſs the reſt of the City, till I got to the Poſt-houſe: But fearing leſt my Voice might betray me,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57769:91" rendition="simple:additions"/> I thought beſt to Counterfeit the Dumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. I advanc'd then towards thoſe whom I pereived to Eye me. I pointed with my Finger under my Chin, then over my Mouth, and gaping made an unarticulate Cry, to give them to underſtand by this Action, that a poor Dumb man begg'd their Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Sometimes I had a compaſſionate Shrug of the Shoulders for an Alms; by and by I felt a ſmall Bribe ſlipt into my Fiſt; and anon again I could hear the good Women mutter, that perhaps I might have been in that manner Mortifyed for the Faith in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key.</hi> In ſhort, I learnt that the begging Trade is a great Book, that Inſtructs us in the manners of People at a cheaper rate, than all the long Voyages of <hi>Columbus</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellan</hi> can.</p>
                     <p>That Stratagem however, could not as yet prevail over the Head-ſtrongneſs of my Deſtiny, nor overcome the ill nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: But what other Invention could I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take my ſelf unto? For to croſs ſo great a City as <hi>Thoulouſe</hi> is, where my Garb had made me known even to the Herring-wives, having more ſhaggy Rags dandling about me, than the erran teſt Tatterdemallion in the World, was it not very likely that I ſhould immediately be taken notice of and known? And that the only charm againſt that danger was to perſonate the Beggar,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57769:92"/> whoſe part is Acted under all Shapes? And then granting this Trick had not been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected with all neceſſary Circumſpection, I fancy ſtill that amongſt ſo many fatal Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, it was a ſign of a very good Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not to run ſtark mad.</p>
                     <p>I was ſetting forward on my Journey then, when all of a ſudden I found my ſelf obliged to turn back again; For my vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Goaler, and about of a dozen of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his Acquaintance, who had reſcued him out of the Hands of the Rabble, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out upon the Hunt, and ſcowring all the Town to find me, fell unluckily in my way. So ſoon as with Eagles Eyes they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me, you may imagine, that they run, and I run, with all the Speed we could. I was ſo nimbly purſued, that ſometimes my Liberty fell upon its Neek, the Breath of the Tyrants who ſought to oppreſs it: But it ſeemed that the Air, which they puſhed forwards running after me, drove me on before them. At length kind Heavens or Fear rather carried me four or five Lanes on Head of them. Then it was that my Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters loſt the ſcent, and I the view and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Noiſe of that troubleſome Chace. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he, that hath not eſcaped ſuch like Agonies, I ſpeak by Experience, can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meaſure the Joy wherewith I was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported, when I found my ſelf out of their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57769:92"/> Clutches. However, ſeeing my Safety requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all my skill, I reſolved avaritiouſly to Husband the time which they ſpent in dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of me. I beſmeared my Face, rubbed my Hair with Duſt, ſtript off my Doublet, let fall my Breeches, threw my Hat in a Cellar; and then having ſpread my Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief upon the Street, with four little Stones on the Corners, as they do who are infected with the Plague, I laid my ſelf down upon my Belly over againſt it, and with a lamentable Tone fell a Groaning moſt languiſhingly. Hardly was I placed in this manner, when I heard the cry of the whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Rabble, long before I heard the ſound of their Feet; but I had ſtill Judgement enough to keep my ſelf in the ſame poſture, in hopes that I might not be known; and I was not miſtaken, for all taking me for one Infected, they paſſed by me in great haſte, ſtopping their Noſes, and moſt of them throwing a Double upon my Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
                     <p>The ſtorm being thus over, I ſlipt into an Ally, put on my Cloths again, and once more truſted my ſelf to Fortune; But I had run ſo long that ſhe was weary of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me. No body could think otherwiſe; for having ſcuddled over ſo many publick Places and Quarters of the Town, tript a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long and turned ſo many Streets, that lofty
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57769:93"/> Goddeſs, unaccuſtomed to march ſo faſt, to put a ſtop to my Carriere, ſuffered me blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fall into the Hands of the Officers that purſued me. At our meeting they thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred out ſo loud an Hue and Cry, that I was quite ſtunn'd with the Noiſe. They thought they wanted Arms enough to hold me, and therefore employed their Teeth, not believing they had me ſure enough; one dragged me by the Hair, another by the Collar, whilſt the leſs paſſionate rifled me; and had better luck than my Goaler at the firſt ſearch, for they found the reſt of my Gold.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe Charitable Phyſicians were taken up in curing the Dropſie of my Purſe, a great Hubbub aroſe; all the place reſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe Words, <hi>kill, kill;</hi> and at the ſame time I ſaw drawn Swords. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who dragg'd me along, cried that they were the Officers of the City Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, who had a mind to take their Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from them. But take heed, ſaid they to me, tugging me along with greater Force, that you do not fall into their Hands, for if ſo, you'll be condemned within four and twenty Hours, and then the King cannot ſave you. At length, however, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being afraid of the Rout, that began to come up with them, left me ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, that I remained all alone in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57769:93"/> of the Street, whilſt the Aggreſſors in the mean time, butchered all they met with. I leave it to you to judge, whether or not I betook my ſelf to my Heels, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe to be equally afraid of both. In a trice I was got at a diſtance from the Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but juſt as I was asking the way to the Poſt-Houſe, a torrent of People that fled from the Scuffle broke into my Street; being unable to reſiſt the Croud, I followed it; and being vexed to run ſo long, I gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at length a little dark Gate, into which I threw my ſelf pell-mell with thoſe that fled. We ſhut it upon our ſelves; and then when we had all taken Breath: Comrades, ſaid one of the Gang, if you'll take my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, let us paſs the two Wickets, and make for the Court. Theſe dreadful Words ſtruck me with ſo ſurpriſing a Grief, that I thought to have fallen dead upon the place. Alas! <hi>I</hi> perceived immediately, but too late, that inſtead of ſaving my ſelf, as <hi>I</hi> thought in a Sanctuary, <hi>I</hi> had caſt my ſelf into Priſon; ſo impoſſible it is to avoid the Influence of ones Watchful Stars. <hi>I</hi> lookt upon that Man more attentively, and knew him to be one of the Officers, who had ſo long given me the Chace: <hi>I</hi> fell into a cold Sweat, and lookt Pale as if <hi>I</hi> had been rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to faint away. They who ſaw me in ſo weak a Condition, being moved with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57769:94"/> call'd for Water; every one drew nigh to aſſiſt me; and by miſchance that accurſed Officer was one of the firſt: He had no ſooner beheld me, but that he knew me. He made a Sign to his Companions, and at the ſame time <hi>I</hi> was ſaluted with an <hi>I Arreſt you Priſoner in Name of the King.</hi> They needed not go far to enrol my Name.</p>

                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:57769:94" rendition="simple:additions"/> me the way by a luſty Thump with his Bunch of Keys; the weight whereof made me tumble and ſlide from the top to the bottom of a dark Aſcent, till <hi>I</hi> knocked againſt a Door that ſtopt me: Nor, indeed, had <hi>I</hi> known it to be a Door, but for the rap <hi>I</hi> gave againſt it: For <hi>I</hi> had not now my Eyes, they remained at the Stairs-Head under the Figure of a Candle, which my Hang-man Guide held in his Hand four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore ſteps above me. At length that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a Man being come down <hi>Pian Piano,</hi> unlocked thirty great Locks, pull'd out as many Bars; and the Wicket being only half opened, with a joult of his Knee he ingulfed me in that Pit, whereof <hi>I</hi> had not time to obſerve the Horrour, ſo ſuddenly he pulled the Door after him. <hi>I</hi> ſtood in mire up to the Knees. If <hi>I</hi> had a mind to get to the ſide, <hi>I</hi> fell in up to the middle. The terrible clucking of the Toads that crawled in the Veſſel, made me wiſh my ſelf Deaf; <hi>I</hi> felt Asks creeping by my Thighs, Serpents twiſting about my Neck; and one <hi>I</hi> eſpied by the ſomber light of his ſparkling Eyes, from a Mouth black with Venom, darting a forked Tongue, whoſe brisk Agitation made it look like a Thunder-bolt, ſet on Fire by its Eyes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> cannot expreſs the reſt; it paſſes all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and beſides, <hi>I</hi> dare not reflect upon
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57769:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> the ſame; ſo afraid I am, that the Aſſurance I think my ſelf in, of being freed from my Priſon, ſhould be no more but a Dream, out of which I am ready to awake. The Gnomon had marked Ten of the Clock up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Dial of the great Tower, before any Body came to knock at my Tomb: But about that time, when bitter Grief and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row began already to preſs my Heart, and diſcompoſe that juſt Harmony wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts Life, I heard a voice that bid me take hold of the Pole that was preſented unto me. Having a long time felt about in the dark to find it, at length I met with one end thereof; with extraordinary motion I took hold on't, and my Goaler pulling the other end towards him; angled me out of the middle of that Mire. I began to ſuſpect that the Countenance of my Affairs was changed, for he ſhew'd me great Civility, ſpoke to me bare-headed, and told me that five or ſix Perſons of Quality waited in the Court to ſee me. Amongſt the reſt, not ſo much as that wild Beaſt who ſhut me up in the Den, which I have deſcribed to you, but had the Impudence to accoſt me, with one Knee on the Ground, having kiſſed my Hand, he beat off a great many Snails that ſtuck to my Hair with one of his Paws, and with the other a great cluſter of Leeches, wherewith my Face was Vizor-masked.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:57769:95"/> Having performed this rare piece of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility; at leaſt, Good Sir, ſaid he to me, you'll think on the Care and Pains that great
<hi>Nicolas</hi> has taken about you: S'death, d'ye mind me, when it was done for the King, it is not for you to upbraid him for it, I trow. Being madded at the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Raſcal, I made him a Sign that I ſhould think on't. Through a Thouſand dreadful turnings, at length I came into the Light, and afterwards into the Court, where as ſoon as I entred it, two Men caught hold on me, whom at firſt I could not know, by reaſon they faſtened about my Neck at the ſame time, and joined their Faces cloſe to mine. It was a pretty while before I could gueſs who they were; but the Tranſports of their Friendſhip intermitting a little, I knew my dear <hi>Colignac,</hi> and the brave Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs. <hi>Colignac</hi> had his Arm in a Scarf, and
<hi>Cuſſan</hi> was the firſt that came out of his Extaſie. Alas! ſaid he, we had never ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected ſuch a diſaſter, had it not been for your Horſe and Mule, who that Night came to my Gate: Their Girths, Cruppers, and all were broken, and that made us preſage ſome Misfortune was befallen you. We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently got on Horſe-back, and had not rid two or three Leagues towards <hi>Colignac,</hi> when all the Country alarm'd at that Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, told us the particular Circumſtances
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57769:96"/> thereof. We preſently gallop'd 'to the Town, where you were in Priſon; but being there informed of your eſcape, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rumor that went, that you had taken your courſe towards <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> with what men we had, we poſted thither in all haſte. The firſt man we asked news of you; told us that you were retaken, at the ſame time we ſpurred our Horſes towards this Priſon; but others aſſured us, that you had vaniſhed out of the Hands of the Serjeants: And as we ſtill went on, the Towns people were telling one another, how you were become inviſible. At length having made further and further inquiry, we came to know that after you had been taken, loſt, and retaken, I know not how many times, you were carried to Priſon, in the great Tower. We way-laid your Officers, and by good-Fortune, through more apparent than real, met, attacked, beat and put them to Flight; but we could not learn, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Wounded whom we took, what was become of you; until this Morning word was brought us, that you your ſelf had blindly ſecured your ſelf in Priſon. <hi>Colig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac</hi> is wounded in ſeveral places, but very ſlightly. After all, we have juſt now taken order, that you be lodged in the faireſt Chamber that's here: Seeing you love an open Air, we have cauſed to be furniſhed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57769:96"/> a little Appartment for you alone in the top of the great Tower, the Terraſs whereof will ſerve you for a Balcony; your eyes, at leaſt will be at Liberty, in ſpight of the Body they are faſtened to. Ha! my Dear <hi>Dyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cona,</hi> cryed the Count ſpeaking next; we were unfortunate we did not take you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with us, when we parted from <hi>Colignac:</hi> My Heart by an unaccountable Sadneſs, that I could give no reaſon for, preſaged ſome terrible Diſaſter; but it matters not, I have Friends, thou art Innocent, and let the worſt come to the worſt, I know what it is to dye Gloriouſly. One thing only puts me in deſpair. The Villain on whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to try the firſt ſtroke of my Revenge, (you well conceive I ſpeak of my Curate) is now out of condition of feeling it; the wretch is dead, and I'll tell you the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of his death: He was running with his Man to drive your Horſe into his Stable, when the Nagg with a fidelity heightened perhaps, by the ſecret notices of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, falling into a ſudden Fury, began to winſe and kick; but with ſo much rage and ſucceſs, that with three kicks of his heels he made Vacant the Benefice of that Buffle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. Without doubt you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Reaſons of that Fools hatred, but I'll diſcover them to you: Know then that I may trace the matter a little backward,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57769:97"/> that that Godly man, a <hi>Norman</hi> by Nation, and a litigious Knave by Trade, who for the Money of Pilgrims officiated in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken Chappel, commenced an Action of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution againſt the Curate of
<hi>Colignac;</hi> and maugre all my endeavours to maintain the Poſſeſſor in his right, ſo wheadled the Judges, that at length in ſpight of us, he was made our Paſtor.</p>
                     <p>At the end of the firſt year, he went to Law with me alſo, pretending that I ſhould pay him Tythes: It was to no purpoſe to tell him, that time out of mind my Lands were free; he went on ſtill with his Suit, which he loſt. But during the Proceſs, he ſtarted ſo many Caſes, that Twenty other Suits have ſprung from them, which now are at a ſtand; thanks to the good Horſe whoſe Foot was harder than
<hi>Maſs-Johns</hi> Head. This is all that I can conjecture of the Vertigo of our Paſtor. But it's won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful with how much fore-ſight he manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Rage: I am lately aſſured, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got into his Head the accurſed deſign of your Impriſonment, he had ſecretly exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Living of
<hi>Colignac,</hi> for another Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his own Country, whither he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to retreat ſo ſoon as you ſhould be taken: Nay his own Man hath ſaid, that ſeeing your Horſe near his Stable, he had heard him mutter, That the Beaſt would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57769:97"/> him into a place, where they could not reach him.</p>
                     <p>After this Diſcourſe, <hi>Colignac</hi> admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to miſtruſt the Offers and Viſit, that perhaps might be rendred me by a very powerful Perſon, whom he named; that it was by his Credit, that
<hi>Maſs-John</hi> had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cauſe of Devolution; and that that Perſon of Quality, had ſollicited the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair for him in recompence of the Services, which that good Prieſt had rendred his Son, when he bore a ſmall Office in the Colledge. Now, continued <hi>Colignac,</hi> ſeeing it is very hard to be at Law without Rancor, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a tincture of Enmity, that remains indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the mind; though we have been made Friends, he hath ever ſince ſought oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions ſecretly to croſs me: But it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not, I have more Relations of the long Robe than he has, and a great many Friends, or if it come to the worſt, we can procure the King to interpoſe his Authority in the Affair.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Colignac</hi> had made an end, they both endeavoured to Comfort me; but it was by ſuch tender Teſtimonies of Sorrow, that my own Grief was thereby encreaſed.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while my Goaler came back, and told us that the Chamber was ready. Come let's go ſee it, anſwered <hi>Cuſſan;</hi> and with that he went firſt, and we followed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57769:98"/> him: I found it in very good Order: I want nothing, ſaid I to them, unleſs it be a few Books. <hi>Colignac</hi> promiſed to fend me next day, as many as I ſhould give him a Catalogue of. When we had well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and found by the height of my Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the largeneſs of the Ditches that envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned it, and by all the Circumſtances of my Apartment, that to eſcape was an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe above humane reach; my Friends looking on one another, and then caſting their Eyes on me, fell a weeping. But as if all of a ſudden our Grief had ſoftened the Anger of Heaven, an unexpected Joy took poſſeſſion of my Soul; Joy brought Hope, and Hope ſecret Illuminations, wherewith my Reaſon was ſo dazled, that with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary Tranſport, which ſeemed ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to my ſelf: Go, ſaid I to them, go expect me at <hi>Colignac;</hi> I ſhall be there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe three days; and ſend me all the Mathematical Inſtruments wherewith I uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally work: In ſhort, you'l find in a large Box, a great many peices of Chriſtal cut into ſeveral Figures, be ſure not to forget them; however, it will be ſooner done, if I ſet down what things <hi>I</hi> need in a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum.</p>
                     <p>They took the Note <hi>I</hi> gave them, being unable to dive into my deſign; and then departed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:57769:98"/> From the time they were gone, <hi>I</hi> did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ruminate upon the Execution of the things <hi>I</hi> had premeditated, and
<hi>I</hi> was thinking on them next day, when all that <hi>I</hi> had ſet down in my Catalogue was brought me from them: One of <hi>Colignac</hi>'s
<hi>Valets de Chamber</hi> told me, that his Maſter had not been ſeen ſince the day before; and that they could not tell, what was become of him. I was not at all troubled at that Accident, becauſe it preſently came into my mind that poſſibly he might be gone to Court to ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite my Liberty: And therefore without being ſurpriſed at it, I put hand to work; for the ſpace of eight days, I hewed, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and glewed, at length I framed the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, that I am about to deſcribe to you.</p>
                     <p>It was a large very light Box, that ſhut tight and cloſe; of about ſix Foot high, and three Foot Square. This Box had a hole in it below; and over the Cover, which had likewiſe a hole in it, I placed a Veſſel of Chriſtal, bored through in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, made in a Globular Figure, but very large, the Orifice whereof joyned exactly to and was enchaced, in the hole I had made in the head.</p>
                     <p>The Veſſel was purpoſely made with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Angles, and in form of an Icoſaedron, to the end that every Facet being convex and concave, my Boul might produce the effect of a Burning-Glaſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:57769:99"/> The Goaler, and his Turn-keys never came up to my Chamber, but they found me employed in this work; but they were not at all ſurpriſed at it, becauſe of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Mechanick Knacks which they met with in my Chamber, whereof I told them I was the Inventor: Amongſt others there was a Wind-Clock, an Artificial Eye, wherewith one might ſee by night; and a Sphere wherein all the Stars followed the regular motion that they have in the Heavens: By theſe things they were perſwaded, that the Machine I was a making, was a Curioſity of the like Nature; and beſides the Money wherewith
<hi>Colignac</hi> greaſed their fiſts, made them go fair and ſoft. Now it was about nine in the Morning; my Keeper was gone down, and the Skie was hazy, when I placed this Machine on the top of my Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that's to ſay, on the openeſt place of my Terraſs walk: It ſhut ſo cloſe, that a grain of Air could not enter it, except by the two openings; and I had placed a little ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light Board within for my ſelf to ſit upon.</p>
                     <p>Things being ordered in this manner, I ſhut my ſelf in, and waited there almoſt an hour, expecting what it might pleaſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to do with me.</p>
                     <p>When the Sun breaking out from under the Clouds, began to ſhine upon my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57769:99"/> that tranſparent Icoſaedron, which through its Facets received the Treaſures of the Sun, diffuſed by it's Orifice the light of them into my Cell; and ſeeing that ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor grew fainter, becauſe of the Beams that could not reach me, without many Refracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that tempered vigour of light convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Caſe into a little Purple Firmament, enameled with Gold.</p>
                     <p>With extaſie I admired the Beauty of ſuch a mixture of Colours; when all of a ſudden <hi>I</hi> found my Bowels to move in the ſame manner, as one finds them that is toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a ſwing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> was about to open my Wicket, to know the cauſe of that emotion; but as <hi>I</hi> was ſtretching out my Hand, through the hole of the Floor of my Box, <hi>I</hi> perceived my Tower already very low beneath me; and my little Caſtle in the Air, puſhing my Feet upwards, in a trice ſhew'd me <hi>Thoulouſe</hi> ſinking into the Earth. That Prodigy ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed me; not at all by reaſon of ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a ſoaring, but becauſe of that dreadful tranſport of Humane Reaſon, at the Succeſs of a deſign, which even frightned me in the Project. The reſt did not at all Startle me; for <hi>I</hi> foreſaw very well, that the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity that would happen in the Icoſaedron, by reaſon of the Sun-beams, united by the concave Glaſſes, would, to fill up the ſpace,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57769:100"/> attract a great abundance of Air, whereby my Box would be carried up; and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably as <hi>I</hi> mounted, the ruſhing wind that ſhould force it through the Hole, could not riſe to the roof, but that furiouſly pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating the Machine, it muſt needs force it up on high. Though my deſign was very cautiouſly projected, yet <hi>I</hi> was miſtaken in one circumſtance; becauſe <hi>I</hi> was not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough of my Glaſſes. <hi>I</hi> had prepared round my Box a little Sail, eaſie to be turned, with a Line that paſſed through the Orifice of the Veſſel; and which <hi>I</hi> held by the end; <hi>I</hi> had fancied to my ſelf, that when <hi>I</hi> ſhould be in the Air, <hi>I</hi> might thus make uſe of as much wind, as might ſerve to convey me to <hi>Colignac:</hi> But in the twin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling of an Eye, the Sun which beat perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly, and obliquely upon the Burning-Glaſſes of the Icoſaedron, hoiſted me up ſo high, that <hi>I</hi> loſt ſight of <hi>Thoulouſe.</hi> That made me let go my ſheet, and ſoon after <hi>I</hi> perceived through one of the Glaſſes, which <hi>I</hi> had put in the four ſides of the Machine, my Sail flying in the Air, and toſſed to and fro by a Whirl-wind that had got with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> remember, that in leſs than an hour <hi>I</hi> was got above the Middle Region; and <hi>I</hi> ſoon perceived it, becauſe
<hi>I</hi> ſaw it hail and rain below me: It may be asked, perhaps,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57769:100"/> whence then came that wind (without which my Box could not mount) in a ſtory in the Sky exempt from Meteors; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided <hi>I</hi> may have a hearing, I'll anſwer that Objection. <hi>I</hi> have told you, that the Sun which beat vigorouſly upon my Concave Glaſſes, uniting his Rayes in the middle of the Veſſel, by his heat drove out the Air it was full of through the upper Conduit; and that ſo the Veſſel being void, Nature, which abhors Vacuity, made it ſuck in, by the opening below, other Air to fill it again: If it loſt much, it regained as much; and ſo one is not to wonder, that in a Region above the middle where the winds are,
<hi>I</hi> continued to mount up; becauſe the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> became wind, by the furious Rapidity wherewith it forced in to hinder a Vacui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and by conſequence ought inceſſantly puſh up my Machine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> felt little or no Hunger, except when <hi>I</hi> paſſed that Middle Region of the Air; for in reality the coldneſs of the Climate, made me ſee it at a diſtance: I ſay at a diſtance, becauſe a Bottle of Spirits which <hi>I</hi> carried always about me, whereof <hi>I</hi> now and then took a dram, kept it from approaching me.</p>
                     <p>During the reſt of my Voyage, <hi>I</hi> felt not the leaſt touch of it; on the contrary the more <hi>I</hi> advanced towards that enflamed World, the ſtronger <hi>I</hi> found my ſelf. <hi>I</hi> ſelt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57769:101"/> my Face to be a little hotter and more gay than ordinary; my Hands appeared to be of an agreable Vermilion Colour, and I know not what Gladneſs mingled with my Blood, which put me beyond my ſelf.</p>
                     <p>I remember, that reflecting once on this Adventure, I reaſoned thus with my ſelf. Hunger without doubt cannot reach me, becauſe that pain being but an Inſtinct of Nature, which prompts Animals to repair by Nouriſhment, what they loſe of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: At preſent when ſhe finds, that the Sun by his pure, continual and neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Irradiation, ſtocks me with more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat than I loſe; ſhe gives me no more that Deſire, which would be uſeleſs. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs I objected againſt thoſe Reaſons, that ſeeing the Temperament which maketh Life, conſiſted not only in natural Heat, but alſo in radical Moiſture, on which that heat is to feed, as the Flame in the Oyl of a Lamp: The ſole Rays of that vital Fire, could not make Life; unleſs they encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſome unctuous Matter that ſhould fix them. But I preſently overcame that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, when I had obſerved, that in our Bodies the radical Moiſture and natural Heat are but one, and the ſelf ſame thing; for that which is called Moiſture, whether in Animals or in the Sun, that great Soul of the World, is but a flux of Sparkles; more
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57769:101"/> continuous becauſe of their Mobility; and that which we name Heat, a Concourſe of Atomes of Fire, which appear looſer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their interruption; but though the radical Moiſture and natural Heat were two diſtinct things, yet it is certain, that the Moiſture would not be neceſſary for living ſo near the Sun; for ſeeing that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity in living Creatures, ſerves only to detain the heat, which would exhale too faſt, and could not be reſtored ſo ſoon; I was in no danger of wanting it, in a Region whereof theſe little Bodies of Flame which conſtitute Life, more of it was united to my Being, then ſeparated from it.</p>
                     <p>There's another thing that may be wondered at; and that is, why the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of that burning Globe conſumed me not, for I was already got almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the full Activity of its ſphere; but I have a reaſon at hand for that. To ſpeak properly, it is not the Fire it ſelf that burns, but a groſſer matter, toſſed to and fro by the dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings out of it's moveable Nature; and that Powder of little Sparks, which I call Fire, moveable of it ſelf, owes, poſſibly, all it's Action to the Roundneſs of it's Atomes; for they tickle, warm, or burn, according to the Figure of the Bodies, which they draw along with them. So Straw ſends not forth ſo burning a Flame as Wood does; Wood
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57769:102"/> burns with leſs violence than Iron; and the Reaſon of this is, becauſe the Fire of Iron, of Wood, and of Straw, though in it ſelf it be the ſame Fire, yet it acts variouſly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diverſity of the Bodys that it moves: And therefore in Straw, the Fire (that ſpiritual Duſt, as it were,) being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled only with a ſoft Body, is leſs corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive: In Wood, whoſe ſubſtance is more compact, it enters more hardly; and in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, the Maſs whereof is almoſt wholely ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, and knit together by Angular Particles, it penetrates and conſumes in a trice whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it touches. Theſe Obſervations being alſo familiar, no Body will wonder, that I approached the Sun without being burnt; ſeeing that which burns is not the Fire, but the matter to which it is joyned, and that the Fire of the Sun, cannot be mingled with any matter. Don't we even find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that Joy which is a Fire, becauſe it only moves an Aërial Blood, whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Particles beat gently againſt the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of our Fleſh, tickles and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces I know not what blind Pleaſure; and that that Pleaſure, or rather that firſt Progreſs of Pain, advances not ſo far as to threaten the Animal with Death; but only to make him ſenſible, that Deſire cauſes a Motion in our Spirits, which we call Joy. Not but that a Feaver, though it have quite
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57769:102"/> contrary Symptoms, is a Fire as well as Joy; but it is a Fire, wrapped up in a Body of Horned Particles, ſuch as the <hi>Atra bilis</hi> or Melancholy, which darting out his hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Points, in all parts where its movable Nature carries it, pierces, cuts, excoriates, and by that violent Agitation, produces that which is called the Heat of a Feaver; but this Concatenation of Proofs is uſeleſs; the moſt vulgar Experiments are ſufficient to convince the obſtinate. I have no time to loſe, I muſt look to my ſelf: I am like <hi>Phaeton</hi> in the middle of a Career, where I cannot turn back again; and wherein if I make but one falſe ſtep, all Nature is not able to ſave me.</p>
                     <p>I perceived moſt diſtinctly, what hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſuſpected, when I went up to the Moon; that, indeed, it is the Earth that moves from Eaſt to Weſt about the Sun, and not the Sun about it: For
<hi>I</hi> ſaw next to <hi>France,</hi> the Foot of the Boot of
<hi>Italy,</hi> then the <hi>Mediterranean-Sea,</hi> then <hi>Greece,</hi> then the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> the <hi>Euxin-Sea, Perſia,</hi> the <hi>Indies, China,</hi> and at length <hi>Japan,</hi> paſs ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively over againſt the hole of my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and ſome Hours after my Elevation, all the South-Sea having turned, gave way to the Continent of <hi>America.</hi> I clearly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed all theſe Revolutions; nay, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that a long time after, <hi>I</hi> ſaw <hi>Europe</hi>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:57769:103"/> mount once more again upon the Scene; but <hi>I</hi> could not now obſerve the ſeparate States thereof, becauſe <hi>I</hi> was exalted too high. <hi>I</hi> left by the way, ſometimes on the right, and ſometimes on the left, ſeveral Earths like ours, where if <hi>I</hi> touched the leaſt upon the Spheres of their Activity, <hi>I</hi> found my ſelf incline ſide-ways: Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the rapid force of my ſoaring Flight, ſurmounted the Power of theſe Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> coaſted by the Moon, which at that time was got betwixt the Sun and the Earth, and <hi>I</hi> left <hi>Venus</hi> on my right-hand. But now <hi>I</hi> am ſpeaking of that Star, the old Aſtronomy hath ſo long preached, that the Planets are Stars which turn round the Earth, that the Modern dares not make a doubt of it: And nevertheleſs, <hi>I</hi> obſerved, that during the whole time, that <hi>Venus</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on this ſide the Sun, about which ſhe turns, <hi>I</hi> ſaw her always Creſcent; but finiſhing her courſe, <hi>I</hi> obſerved that as ſhe paſt gradually behind him, the Horns drew nearer, and her Black Belly was guilt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Now this viciſſitude of Light and Darkneſs, makes it very evident, That the Planets are like the Moon and the Earth, Globes without Light, capable only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect that which they borrow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:57769:103"/> The Truth is, as <hi>I</hi> ſtill mounted, <hi>I</hi> made the ſame Obſervation of <hi>Mercury. I</hi> obſerved beſides, that all theſe Worlds have other little Worlds alſo which move about them. Muſing afterwards on the Cauſes of the Conſtruction of this great Univerſe, I imagined that at the clearing of the <hi>Chaos,</hi> after that God had created the Matter, Bodies of the like Nature joined together, by that Principle of unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Love, by which we ſee by Experience that every thing covets its like; Particles formed after a certain Faſhion aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and that made Air: Others again, to which the ſhape gave a circular Motion, by clinging faſt together, compoſed the Globes that are called Stars, which not only, becauſe of that Inclination of whirling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout upon their Poles, to which their Figure determines them, ought to truſs together into a Round as we ſee them; but ought in the ſame manner, as they evaporated from the Maſs, and kept a Parallel March in their flight, make the leſſer Orbs, which they met in the Sphere of their Activity, to turn: And therefore
<hi>Mercury, Venus,</hi> the Earth, <hi>Mars, Jupiter,</hi> and
<hi>Saturn,</hi> have been conſtrained to whirlegig it, and move both at once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sun. Not but that one may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that heretofore all thoſe other Globes have been Suns, ſince the Earth ſtill retains
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57769:104"/> in ſpight of its preſent Extinction, heat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make the Moon turn about it, by the circular motion of the Bodies, which are detach'd from its Maſs, and that <hi>Jupiter</hi> retains enough to make four to turn: But theſe Suns by the length of time, have ſuſtained ſo conſiderable a loſs of Light and Fire, by the continual Emiſſion of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bodies, which make Heat and Light; that they remain no more but a cold, dark, and almoſt unactive <hi>Caput Mortuum.</hi> Nay, we diſcover that theſe ſpots which are in the Sun, and were not perceived by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, dayly increaſe: Now, who can tell but that it is a Cruſt formed in its Superfice, it's Maſs that extinguiſhes proportionably as the Light leaves it; and if it become not, when all theſe moveable Bodies have aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned it, an obſcure Body like the Earth? There are very diſtant Ages, beyond which there appears no Veſtige of Man-kind: perhaps heretofore, the Earth was a Sun peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with Animals, proportioned to the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that produces them; and perhaps theſe Animals, were the <hi>Demons</hi> of whom Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity relates ſo many Inſtances. Why not? Is it not poſſible, that theſe Animals after the Extinction of the Earth, have ſtill lived there for ſome time, and that the Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Globe, had not as yet deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their Race? In effect, their life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57769:104" rendition="simple:additions"/> until the time of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Teſtimony of <hi>Plutarch.</hi> It would even ſeem, that the prophetick and ſacred Teſtament of our Primitive Patriarchs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to lead us by the Hand to that truth. For we read in it of the Revolt of Angels, before mention is made of Man. Is not that Sequel of time, which the Scripture ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, half of a Proof in a manner, that Angels inhabited the Earth before us? And that theſe proud Blades, who had lived in out World, whilſt it was a Sun, diſdaining, perhaps, ſince it was extinct, to abide any longer in it, and knowing that God had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Throne in the Sun, had the boldneſs to adventure to invade it? But God who reſolved to puniſh their Audacity, baniſh'd them even from the Earth, and created Man leſs perfect, but by conſequence leſs proud, to poſſeſs their vacant Habitations.</p>
                     <p>About the end of four Months Voyage, at leaſt as near as one can reckon, when there is no Night to diſtinguiſh the Day; I came upon the Coaſt of one of thoſe little Earths that wheel about the Sun, which the Mathematicians call Spots; where by reaſon that Clouds interpoſed, my Glaſſes now not uniting ſo much heat, and by conſequence the Air not puſhing my Shed with ſo much Force, what remained of the Wind could do no more, but bear up
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57769:105"/> my fall, and let me down upon the top of a very high Mountain, to which I gently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended.</p>
                     <p>I leave it to you to conſider what Joy I felt, when I ſaw my Feet upon firm Ground, after I had ſo long acted the part of a Fowl. Words, indeed, are too weak to expreſs the Extaſie of Gladneſs I found my ſelf in; when, at length, I perceived my Head Crowned with the Brightneſs of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. However, I was not ſo far tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted yet with that Extaſie, but that <hi>I</hi> thought of getting out of my Box, and of covering the Capital thereof with my Shirt before <hi>I</hi> left it; becauſe I was apprehenſive, that if the Air becoming Serene, the Sun ſhould again kindle my Glaſſes, as it was likely enough, I might find my Houſe no more.</p>
                     <p>By Gullies which ſeemed hollowed by the fall of Water,
<hi>I</hi> deſcended into the Plain, where becauſe of the thick Mud, that fatned the Earth, I had much ado to go: However, having advanced a little way,
<hi>I</hi> arrived in a great Bottom, where <hi>I</hi> rencountred a little Man ſtark-naked, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and reſting himſelf upon a Stone. <hi>I</hi> cannot call to mind whether <hi>I</hi> ſpoke to him firſt, or if it was he that put the Queſtion to me: But it is as freſh in my Memory, as if
<hi>I</hi> heard him ſtill, that he diſcourſed to me three long Hours in a Language, which <hi>I</hi>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:57769:105"/> knew very well <hi>I</hi> had never heard before, and which hath not the leaſt reſemblance with any of the Languages in this World; notwithſtanding <hi>I</hi> comprehended it faſter, and more intelligibly than my Mother Tongue. He told me, when <hi>I</hi> made enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about ſo wonderful a thing, that in Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences there was a <hi>true,</hi> without which one was always far from the <hi>eaſie;</hi> that the more an Idiom was diſtant from this <hi>truth,</hi> the more it came ſhort of the Conception, and was leſs eaſie to be underſtood. In the ſame manner, continued he, in Muſick one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver finds this <hi>true;</hi> but that the Soul im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately riſes, and blindly aſpires after it. We ſee it not, but we feel that Nature ſees it; and without being able to conceive, in what manner we are ſwallowed up by it, it ſtill raviſhes us, tho we cannot obſerve where it is. It's the very ſame with Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; he who hits upon that verity of Letters, Words, and Order in expreſſing himſelf, can never fall below his thought, he ſpeaks always with congruity to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; and it is becauſe you are ignorant of this perfect Idiom, that you are at a ſtand, not knowing the Order, nor the Words, which might explain what you imagine.
<hi>I</hi> told him, that the firſt Man of our World, had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly made uſe of that Language, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſeveral Names which he gave to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57769:106"/> ſeveral things, declared their Eſſence. He interrupted me, and went on. It is not abſolutely neceſſary, for expreſſing all the mind conceives, but without it we cannot be underſtood of all. Seeing this Idiom is the Inſtinct or Voice of Nature; it ought to be intelligible to all that live under the Juriſdiction of Nature: And therefore if you underſtood it, you might Diſcourſe and Communicate all your thoughts to Beaſts, and the Beaſts theirs to you; becauſe it is the very Language of Nature, whereby ſhe makes her ſelf to be underſtood by all Living Creatures.</p>
                     <p>Be no more ſurpriſed, then, at the faoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity wherewith you underſtand the meaning of a Language, which never ſounded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in your Ear. When I ſpeak, your Soul finds in every Word of mine, that
<hi>Truth</hi> which it gropes after; and though her Reaſon underſtand it not, yet ſhe has Nature with her that cannot fail to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it.</p>
                     <p>Ha! without doubt, cried <hi>I,</hi> it was by the means of that Emphatick Idiom, that our firſt Father heretofore converſed with Animals, and was by them underſtood; for ſeeing the Dominion over all the kinds of them, was given to him, they obeyed him, becauſe he commanded in a Language that was known to them; and it is for
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57769:106"/> that Reaſon alſo, that (this Original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage being loſt) they come not at preſent, when they are called, as heretofore they did, ſeeing now they do not underſtand us.</p>
                     <p>The little Man ſeemed as if he had no mind to anſwer me; but reſuming his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he was about to go on, if I had not once again interrupted him. I asked him, then, what World it was that we breathed in, if it was much inhabited; and what kind of Government they lived under? I am going, replyed he, to diſcover Secrets to you, which are not known in your Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
                     <p>Conſider well the Ground whereon we go; it is not long, ſince it was an indigeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſorderly Maſs, a Chaos of confuſed Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a black and glewy Filth, whereof the Sun had purged it ſelf: Now after that by the force of the rays, which the Sun dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt it, he mingled, preſſed, and compacted thoſe numerous Clouds of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes: After, I ſay, that by a long and powerful Coction, he ſeparated the more contrary, and reverted the more ſimilary parts of this Bowl; the Maſs pierced through with heat ſweat ſo, that it made a Deluge, which covered it above Forty days; for ſo much Water required no leſs time, to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ll down into the more declining and lower Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of our Globe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:57769:107"/> The Liquor of theſe Torrents being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, formed the Sea, which by its Salt makes it ſtill apparent, that it muſt needs be a conflux of Sweat; all ſweat being Salt. When the Waters were retired, a fat and fertile Mud remained upon the Earth: Now when the Sun ſhone out, there aroſe a kind of a Tumor or Wheal, which could not, becauſe of the Cold, thruſt out its bud: It therefore received another coction; and that coction ſtill rectifying and perfecting it by a more exact mixture, it ſent forth a Sprout; endowed then only with Vegetati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but capable of Senſe: But becauſe the Waters, which had ſo long ſtood upon the ſlime, had too much chilled it, the ſwelling broke not; ſo that the Sun recocted it once more; and after a third Digeſtion, that Matrix being ſo thoroughly heated, that the Cold brought forth a Man; who hath retained in the Liver, which is the ſeat of the vegetative Soul, and the place of the firſt Concoction, the power of Growing; in the Heart, which is the ſeat of Activity, and the place of ſecond Concoction, the vital Power; and in the Brain, which is the ſeat of the Intellectual, and the place of the third Concoction, the power of Reaſoning: Otherwiſe, why ſhould we be longer in the Womb of our Mothers, than the reſt of Animals, unleſs it be that our <hi>Embryo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57769:107"/> three diſtinct Concoctions, for form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the three diſtinct Faculties of our Soul; and the Beaſts only two, for forming their two Powers? I know that the Horſe is not compleated in the Belly of the Mare, before the tenth, twelſth, or fourteenth Month: But ſeeing he is of a Conſtitution, ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that which makes us men, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has Life but in Months, which are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be fatal to ours, when we remain in the Womb beyond the natural Courſe; it is no wonder, that Nature needs another pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of time for delivering a Mare, than that which brings a Woman to Bed. It is ſo; but in fine, ſome body may ſay, The Horſe remains longer than we in the Belly of his Mother; and by conſequence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives there, either more perfect, or more numerous Coctions: I anſwer, that it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not; for, not to rely upon the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, that ſo many Learned men have made upon the <hi>Energy</hi> of numbers, when they prove, That all Matter being in motion, ſome Beings are compleated in a certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of days, which are deſtroyed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; nor yet to lay any great ſtreſs, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Arguments they deduce, from the Cauſe of all theſe motions, to prove that the number <hi>Nine</hi> is the moſt perfect; I ſhall content my ſelf with this anſwer, That the Bud of man being hotter, the Sun interferes
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57769:108"/> and compleats more Organs in the ſpace of nine Months, than he hath rough-hew'n in a Colt during a whole year. Now it is not to be doubted, but that a Horſe is a great deal colder than a Man; ſeeing that Beaſt never dies, but of a Swelling of the Spleen, or other Diſeaſes that proceed from Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. Nevertheleſs, you'l tell me, there is no man in our World engendred of Mud, and produced in that manner: I believe it, your World at preſent is over-heated; for ſo ſoon as the Sun draws a ſprout out of the Earth, finding none of that cold Humidity, or to ſay better, that certain Period of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated Motion, which obliges it to ſeveral Coctions, it turns it preſently into a Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; or if it make two Coctions, ſeeing the ſecond has not time enough to receive per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in, it only engenders an Inſect. And it is a Remark that I have made alſo, That the Ape, which, as we, carrys it's young almoſt nine Months, reſembles us in ſo many Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, that not a few Naturaliſts have rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us in the ſame Species; and the reaſon is, that their Seed being of a temper, much like ours, hath during that time, had almoſt the leiſure to perfect thoſe three Digeſtions.</p>
                     <p>You'l undoubtedly ask me, of whom I have the Story, that now I have told you; you'l tell me, that I could not have had it from thoſe that were not in being: It's true,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57769:108"/> I am the only perſon that hath hit upon it, and by conſequence I can give no Vouchers for it, becauſe it's a thing that happened before I was born; that's likewiſe true: But take this along with you alſo, That in a Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion bordering upon the Sun, as ours does, the Souls full of Fire are more illuminated, more ſubtile, and more penetrant, than thoſe of other Animals in remoter Spheres. Now ſeeing even in your World, there have been Prophets heretofore, whoſe minds, heightened by a vigorous Inſpiration, have had Fore-knowledge of future things; it is not impoſſible, but that in this, which is far nearer the Sun, &amp; by conſequence more lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous than yours, a ſtrong <hi>Genius</hi> may have ſome ſmelling of what is paſt; that his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Reaſon may move as well backwards, as forwards, and that it may be able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Cauſe by the Effects, ſeeing it can reach the Effects by the Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus he ended his Philoſophical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe; but after a more particular Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that we had, about very deep Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, which he revealed to me; part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I'll conceal, and of which the reſt has eſcaped me; he told me, That it was not as yet three Weeks, ſince a clod of Earth, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated by the Sun, was brought to Bed of him. Conſider that Tumor attentively. Then he made me obſerve, I know not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57769:109"/> what Swelling upon the Mud, not unlike to a Mole-Hill: That, ſays he, is an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume, or to ſay better, a Matrix, which for theſe Nine Months paſt, hath contained the Embryo of one of my Brothers. I wait here, on deſign to play the part of a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife to it.</p>
                     <p>He would have gone on, had he not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Palpitation of the Earth, about that Swelling of Clay. That with the bigneſs of the Tumor, made him conclude, that the Earth was in Labour, and that that Shake, was already the effort of the Pangs of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. He thereupon immediately left me, that he might run to it; and for my part, I went to look for my Lodge.</p>
                     <p>I therefore clambered up again the Mountain, I had come down from, and was very weary before I got to the top of it. You may imagine what trouble I was in, when I did not find my Houſe, where I had left it. I began to lament the loſs of it, when I perceived it, skipping and vaulting at a great diſtance; I ran thither, as faſt as my Legs could carry me, till I was out of Breath again; and really, it was an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Diverſion, to behold that new way of Courſing; for ſometimes, when I had almoſt my Hand upon it, a new encreaſe of Heat, got into the Glaſs-Ball, which attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Air with more force, and that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57769:109"/> Air raiſing my Box up above my reach, made me leap after it, as a Cat does to a Hook, where it ſees a Hare hanging. Had not my Shirt been upon the Capital, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the force of the Glaſſes, it would have made the Voyage by it ſelf alone.</p>
                     <p>But to what purpoſe is it, to call to mind an Accident that I cannot think on, but with the ſame Grief, that I felt at that time! It's enough to know, that it bounded, row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and flew ſo long; and that I jumped, run, and skipped ſo much, that at length, I ſaw it fall down, at the Foot of a very high Hill. It had perhaps led me a Dance, a great deal farther, had not that lofty Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Earth, by its ſhade, that black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Sky, to a large diſtance upon the Plain, ſpread forth a Night of half a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues Circumference: For falling into that Darkneſs, the Glaſs thereof no ſooner felt the Cool, but that no more Vacuity was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred in it, no more Wind through the Hole, and by conſequence, no more Impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſupport it; ſo that it tumbled down, and would have broken into a Thouſand ſhivers, had not by good luck, a Pond of Water, into which it fell, yielded under the weight. I drew it out of the Water, repaired what was bruiſed; and then hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken faſt hold of it in my Arms, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it to the top of a little Hill, hard by.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57769:110"/> There I took my Shirt off on't; but I could not put it on, becauſe my Glaſſes beginning to work their effect, I perceived my Caſtle already wagging to be gone. I had no more time left, but ſuddenly to get in, where I ſhut my ſelf up as at firſt.</p>
                     <p>The Sphere of our World, appeared to me as a Planet, much about the bigneſs of the Moon, as ſhe appears to us: Nay, it grew leſs and leſs, ſtill proportionably as I aſcended, infomuch that it became a Star, then a Spark, and then nothing at all; for that luminous Point grew ſo ſharp, that it might equal that, which terminates the laſt Ray of my ſight; that at length it was ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the common colour of the Heavens. Some perhaps may wonder, that during ſo long a Voyage, I was not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with Sleep; but ſeeing Sleep is only produced by the gentle Exhalation of the Victuals, which evaporate from the Stomach to the Brain, or by a Neceſſity that Nature finds of locking up our Soul, that during Repoſe, ſhe may recover as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Spirits, as have been ſpent in Exerciſe: I had no mind to Sleep, ſince I did not Eat, and that the Sun ſupplied me, with more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Heat, than I conſumed. In the mean while, my Elevation continued, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, as it brought me nearer to that enflamed World, I felt a certain Joy diffuſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57769:110"/> it ſelf through my Blood, which rectified it, and advanced to my very Soul. Ever now and then I looked upwards, that I might admire the Vivacity of the Luſtre, that rayed into my little Chryſtal-Houſe; and it is freſh in my Memory ſtill, that at the time I put my Eye to the Orifice of the Veſſel, behold, with a ſudden ſtart, I felt ſomething heavy, that fled from all the parts of my Body. A whirling Cloud of very thick, and, in a manner, palpable Smoak, choaked my Glaſs with Darkneſs; and when I ſtood up to contemplate that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, which blinded me, I ſaw no more, neither Veſſel, nor Burning Glaſſes, Glaſs-Window, nor Covering to my Shed: I looked down, then, with Deſign to ſee what made my Maſter-piece thus fall to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; but in place of it, and of the four Sides and Floor, I found nothing but the Heavens round about me. I was frightned beyond meaſure, when I found, as if the Air had been petrified, I know not what inviſible Obſtacle, which forced back my Arms, when I thought to ſtretch them forth. It came then into my Imagination, that mounting ſo high, I had without doubt got into the Firmament, which ſome Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and Aſtronomers have maintained to be ſolid. I began to fear, I ſhould remain ſtudded in there; but the Horrour that the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57769:111"/> oddneſs of that Accident caſt me into, was exceedingly encreaſed by thoſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: For my ſight, that rambled here and there, falling by chance upon my Breaſt, inſtead of ſtopping at the Surface of my Body, went quite through; then a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after, I thought I ſaw behind me, and almoſt without any interval, as if my Body had been no more but an Organ of ſight: I perceived that my Fleſh, being cleanſed from its Opacity, transferr'd Objects to my Eyes, and my Eyes Objects through it. At length, having above a Thouſand times knockt againſt the Roof, Floor, and Walls of my Chair-volant, without being able to ſee it; I found, that through a ſecret Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Light in its ſource, my Shed and I were both become tranſparent. Not but that I ought to have perceiv'd it, though
<hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous,</hi> ſeeing we very well perceive Glaſs, Chryſtal, and Diamonds that are ſo; but I fancy that the Sun, in a Region ſo near himſelf, purges Bodies more perfectly from their Opacity, by ranking more ſtraightly the imperceptible Pores of the Matter, than in our World; where his Force, worn out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt by ſo long a paſſage, is hardly able to transfuſe his Luſtre into precious Stones: However, by reaſon of the internal Smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Surfaces, he makes them reflect through their Glaſſes, as through little
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57769:111"/> Eyes, either the Green of Emeralds, the Scarlet of Rubies, or the Violet of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyſts, according as the different Pores of the Stone, either more ſtraight or more winding, extinguiſh or rekindle that weak Light, by a great many Reflexions. One difficulty may puzzle the Reader, to wit, How I could ſee my ſelf, and not my Houſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I was become Diaphanous, as well as it? I anſwer, That without doubt the Sun acts otherwiſe upon animate, than upon inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Bodies; becauſe no part neither of my Fleſh, Bones nor Entrails, tho' tranſparent, had loſt its Natural Colour; on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, my Lungs under an incarnate Red, ſtill retained their delicate Softneſs: My Heart ſtill Vermilion, gently moved with its <hi>Syſtole,</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole:</hi> My Liver ſeemed to burn in a Purple Red, and boyling the Air which I breathed, continued the Circulation of the Blood: In ſhort, I ſaw, touched, and felt my ſelf to be the ſame, and nevertheleſs I was not ſo.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt I was conſidering this Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, my Voyage grew ſhorter and ſhorter ſtill, but with a great deal of ſlowneſs then, by reaſon of the Serenity of the <hi>Aether,</hi> which was rarified proportionably, as I drew nearer the ſource of Day; for ſeeing the matter in that Region is very thin, becauſe of the great Vacuity it is full of, and that by conſequence
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57769:112"/> that Matter is very lazy, by reaſon of the Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity that has no <hi>Action,</hi> that Air paſſing through the hole of my Box, could not produce but a little Wind, hardly able to ſupport it.</p>
                     <p>I never reflected upon the Malicious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priciouſneſs of Fortune, which always ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinatly oppoſed the Succeſs of my underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but I wonder my brains did not turn. But liſten to a Miracle, which future Ages will hardly be inclined to believe.</p>
                     <p>Being ſhut up in a Box as clear as day, that I had juſt loſt ſight of, and my flight flagging ſo, that I had much ado not to fall; in a word, being in a condition, that all that's contained in the great Fabrick of the World, was unable to aſſiſt me; I found my ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Period of extream Misfortune: Nevertheleſs, as when we are expiring, we find an internal Impulſe in us, to embrace thoſe who have given us a Being; I lifted up my Eyes to the Sun, our common Father. That ardour of Will, not only ſupported my Body, but alſo raiſed it up towards the thing, which it aſpired to embrace. My Body puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forwards my Box, and in that manner I continued my Vovage. So ſoon as I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, more intenſly than ever, I plyed all the faculties of my Soul, to raiſe my Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation towards that which attracted me; but my head being loaded with my Shed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the upper-part whereof, the Efforts
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57769:112"/> of my Will puſht it, whether I would or not, that did ſo incommode me, that at length ſo much weight, forced me to grope for the place of its inviſible Door. By good fortune I found it, and having opened it, threw my ſelf out: But that natural Apprehenſion of falling, which all Animals have, when they find nothing to ſupport them, made me briskly ſtretch forth my Arm, that I might take hold of ſomewhat: I had no other Guide but Nature, which ſtands not upon Reaſoning; and therefore Fortune, her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, maliciouſly forced my hand upon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of Chryſtal. Alas! what Thunder-clap to my Ears, was the ſound of the Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaedron, which to my hearing broke in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces! Such a Diſorder, Misfortune, and Fright are beyond all expreſſions! The Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes attracted no more Air, for no more Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity was made; the Air became no more wind, by its haſtening to fill it, and the wind ceaſed to carry my Box on high: In ſhort, immediately after that wrack, I ſaw it long a falling through thoſe vaſt plains of the World. It recontracted in the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the dark Opacity which it had exhaled; in reſpect that the energetick Vertue of the Light, ceaſing in that place, it greedily vnited again to the obſcure Thickneſs, which was in a manner eſſential to it; in the ſame manner as Spirits, long after their Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57769:113"/> have been ſeen to come in ſearch of their Bodies, and that they might rejoyn them, to wander for the ſpace of an hundred years about their Graves. I fancy it loſt in this manner its Tranſparency, for I have ſeen it ſince in <hi>Poland,</hi> in the ſame condition it was in, when firſt I entered it. Now I have been informed, that it fell under the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial Line, in the Kingdom of <hi>Borneo;</hi> that a
<hi>Portugueſs</hi> Merchant bought it of the Iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that found it, and that from hand to hand, it fell into the poſſeſſion of that
<hi>Poliſh</hi> Engineer, who makes uſe of it at preſent to fly with.</p>
                     <p>Thus, then, hanging in the open ſpace of the Heavens, and terrified already by the Death, which my fall threatned me with, I turned, as I told you, my ſad eyes towards the Sun: My Sight carried my thought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and my Looks being fixed upon his Globe, marked out a way which my Will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, to tranſport my Body to the ſame place.</p>
                     <p>That vigorous Launching out of my Soul, will not be incomprehenſible to any, that will but conſider, the ſimple Efforts of our Will; as, for Inſtance, It is very well known, that when I have a mind to leap, my Will being excited by my Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, raiſes the whole Microcoſm, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to tranſport it to the mark, that it
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57769:113"/> propoſed to it ſelf. If it attain not always to it, it's becauſe that the Univerſal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Nature prevail over the Particul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and that the Power of Willing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particular to ſenſitive Beings; and that of falling to the Center, proper to all things, mater<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> in general; my Leap is forced to ceaſe, ſo ſoon as the Maſs of my Body, having overcome the Inſolence of the Will, that ſurprized it, draws near the Point to which it tends.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall wave what elſe happened to me, during the reſt of my Voyage, leſt I ſhould be as long in relating, as I was in making it: I'll only tell you in general, that at the end of 22. Months, I at length happily arrived at the great plains of Day.</p>
                     <p>That Land looks like flakes of burning Snow, ſo luminous it is; nevertheleſs it is a thing pretty incredible, that I could never comprehend, after that my Box fell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I mounted up, or deſcended towards the Sun. I only remember, when I arrived there, that I walkt lightly; I toucht only the Ground in a point, and I often rowled like a Bowl, finding it alike commodious, to walk either upon my Head or Feet. Though ſometimes my Feet were towards Heaven, and my Shoulders towards the Earth; yet in that poſture, I found my ſelf as naturally ſituated, as if my Feet had
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57769:114"/> been towards the Earth, and my Shoulders towards Heaven. Upon what part ſoever of my Body I placed my ſelf, whether up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Belly, or Back, on Elbow or Ear, I found my ſelf ſtanding. By that I knew, that the Sun is a World, which hath no Center; and that as I was far enough from the active Sphere of ours, and of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which I met; ſo by conſequence, it was impoſſible, that I ſhould ſtill be ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſeeing Weight is nothing elſe, but an Attraction of the Center, within the Sphere of its Activity.</p>
                     <p>The Reſpect, wherewith I printed my ſteps upon that Luminous Plain, ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſome time, the eager Deſire I had to advance on my Journey. I was all aſhamed to walk upon the Day: Nay, and my aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Body, deſiring to relie upon mine Eyes; and that tranſparent Ground, which they pierced, not being able to ſupport them; my Inſtinct in ſpight of me, now become Maſter of my thought, hurried it into the Abyſs of a bottomleſs Light. My Reaſon nevertheleſs, by degrees undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved my Inſtinct; I walked confidently, and without trembling upon the Plain, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected my ſteps ſo boldly, that if Men could have perceived me from their World, they would have taken me for ſome Power marching upon the Clouds. Having, as I think,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57769:114"/> travelled about fifteen days time, I came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Country of the Sun, not ſo reſplendent as thoſe I had left. I found my ſelf tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Joy, and I imagined, that undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly that Joy proceeded from a ſecret Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, which my Being ſtill retained with its Opacity. Nevertheleſs, the knowledge I had of this, made me not deſiſt from my Enterpriſe; for then I was like to thoſe ſleepy Old men, who tho' they know that ſleep is hurtful to them, and that they have ordered their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to ſnatch them out of it's Clutches, are nevertheleſs very angry when they awaken them. In like manner, tho' my Body growing obſcure, as I reached the darker Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, recontracted the weakneſſes, that that infirmity of matter brings along with it; yet I was pleaſed therewith: Growing wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſleep invaded me; for that flattering Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs, wherewith the approaches of ſleep charms us, diſtilled ſo much pleaſure into my Veins, that my Senſes over come thereby, forced my Spirit to congratulate the Tyrant, who chained its Servants; for Sleep, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Tyrant of one half of our days, who becauſe of his Old age, being unable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Light, or to look on it without fainting, was forced to forſake me, upon my entry into the ſhining Countries of the Sun, was come to expect me on the Confines of the dusky Region I ſpeak of; where having
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57769:115"/> caught me, he made me Priſoner, ſhut up my Eyes, his declared enemies, under the dark vault of my Eye-lids; and for fear that my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Senſes betraying him, as they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed me, might diſturb him in the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able poſſeſſion of his Conqueſt, he tied them faſt to their ſeveral Beds. The meaning of all this is in two words, that I lay down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sand, and fell aſleep. It was a plain Country, and ſo open that as far as my ſight could reach, I did not diſcover ſo much as one Buſh; and nevertheleſs when I a woke, I found my ſelf under a Tree, in reſpect of which the talleſt Cedars would but appear as Graſs. The Trunk of it was of Maſſive Gold, it's Branches of Silver, and it's Leaves of Emeralds, which upon the reſplendent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of their precious Surface, repreſented, as in a Looking-Glaſs, the Images of the Fruit that hang about them. But judge ye whether the Fruit owed any thing to the Leaves; the enflamed Scarlet of a large Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle, compoſed one half of every one of them; and the other was in ſuſpence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it held it's matter of a Chryſolite, or of a piece of gilt Amber; the blown Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms were large Roſes of Diamonds, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riental Pearls the Buds.</p>
                     <p>A Nightingale, whoſe ſmooth Plume ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it exceeding lovely, perching on the higheſt ſprig, ſeemed ſollicitous, with it's
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57769:115"/> Melody, to force the Eyes to confeſs to the Ears, that it well deſerved the Throne where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſate.</p>
                     <p>I ſtood a long while amazed at the ſight of that rich Spectacle, and I could not have my full of beholding it: But whilſt my thoughts were wholly taken up in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, amongſt the other Fruit, an exceeding lovely Pomegranate, whoſe Fleſh was a ſwarm of large Rubies in cluſters, I ſaw that little Crown that ſtands it inſtead of a Head move, which lengthened it ſelf, as much as was needful, to form a Neck; next I ſaw ſomewhat white bubble and boil over it, which by means of Condenſation, Concretion advancing and repelling the matter in certain places, appeared at length to be the face of a little bulk of Fleſh. That little bulk ſhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf into a round Figure towards the girdle, that's to ſay, that in the lower part of it, it ſtill retained the ſhape of an Apple. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it extended it ſelf by degrees, and the tail of it being converted into two Legs, each Leg divided it ſelf into five Toes. So ſoon as the Pomegranate was humanized, it broke off from its ſtalk, and with a gentle Toſs fell juſt at my Feet. I confeſs, really, when I ſaw marching ſtately before me that rational Apple, that little Butt-end of a Dwarf, no bigger than my Thumb, and yet ſo powerful as to create himſelf; I was ſeized
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57769:116"/> with Veneration. Human Animal (ſaid he to me, in that Original Tongue I told you of before,) after I had long conſidered thee, from the top of the Branch where I hung; I thought I read in thy countenance, that thou waſt no Native of this World, and that's the reaſon why I am come down to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the truth. When I had ſatisfied his Curioſity, as to all the queſtions he put to me—But pray, ſaid I to him, tell me who you are; for what I have now ſeen, is ſo ſtrangely ſurpriſing, that I deſpair of ever knowing the Cauſe of it, unleſs you diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it to me. How! a great Tree all of pure Gold, the Leaves whereof are Emeralds, the Flowers Diamonds, the Buds Pearls; and beſides all that, Fruit that make themſelves men in the twinkling of an Eye? For my part, I confeſs it paſſes my Capacity, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſuch a Miracle. Having uttered this Exclamation, whilſt I expected his anſwer: You will not take it amiſs, ſaid he to me, if being King of all the people that make up this Tree, I call them to follow me. When he had ſo ſaid, I obſerved that he recoiled within himſelf: I cannot tell, whether by bending the internal ſprings of his Will, he excited without him ſome Motion, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced what now you ſhall hear: But ſo it is, That immediately after, all the Leaves and Branches, in ſhort the whole Tree, broke
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57769:116"/> to pieces, and became little Men, that ſaw, felt, and walked, who as if they intended to celebrate their Birth-day, at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of their production, fell a dancing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me: Of all, I ſaw none but the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingale retained it's former ſhape, and was not at all Metamorphoſed; it came and perched upon the Shoulder of our little Monarch, where it Sung ſo melancholick and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>orous an Air, that the whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and the Prince himſelf, mollified by the ſweet Languiſhings of its dying Voice, could not forbear to ſhed ſome Tears. A Curioſity to learn whence that Bird came, ſeized me at that time, with ſuch an extraordinary Itch of Tongue, that I could not for my heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it. Sir, ſaid I, addreſſing my ſelf to the King, did I not fear to trouble your Majeſty, I would ask you the queſtion, why amongſt ſo many Transformations, the Nightingale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone hath retained its kind? That little Prince liſtened to me with ſo much Civility, that it ſhew'd he had a great deal of good Nature; and knowing my Curioſity: The Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale, replied he, hath not changed its Form as we have done, becauſe it could not; it's a real Bird, and nothing elſe than what it appears to be to you. But let's go towards the obſcurer Regions, and by the way I'll tell you who I am, and give you the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Nightingale. Hardly had I intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57769:117"/> to him, the Satisfaction that I receiv'd from his offer, when he ſkipped nimbly up upon one of my Shoulders. He ſtood upon his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Tip-toes, that he might reach my ear with his Mouth; and ſometimes ſwinging, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times peſtered in my Hair: In troth, ſaid he, thou muſt e'en excuſe one that's already out of breath; ſeeing in a narrow Body my <hi>Lungs</hi> are contracted, and by conſequence my Voice ſo ſmall, that I am forced to take a great deal of pains, to make my ſelf be heard: The Nightingale would do beſt, to tell it's own Hiſtory it ſelf; let it ſing, then, if it think fit, we ſhall have the Pleaſure, at leaſt to hear it's Story in Muſick. I replied, that I was not as yet, ſufficiently acquainted with the Language of the Bird; that a certain Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, indeed, whom I met with, as I was mounting up to the Sun, had given me ſome general Principles, for underſtanding the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Brutes; but that they were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, for the underſtanding of all words in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, nor for being affected with all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies that occur in an adventure, ſuch as that muſt needs be. Well then, ſaid he, ſince thou'lt have it ſo, thine Ears ſhall not only be deprived of the ſweet Songs of the Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale; but in a manner of all its adventure alſo, of which I can tell thee no more, than what is come to my knowledge: However be content with that Pattern; beſides tho'
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57769:117"/> I knew it fully, yet the ſhortneſs of our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into it's Country, whither I am going to carry it back again, would not ſuffer me to enlarge in my Relation. Having ſaid ſo, he jumpt down from my Shoulder upon the ground; then he gave the hand to all his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle People, and fell a dancing with them in a kind of Figure, that I cannot repreſent, the like having never ſeen. But hearken, O ye people of the Earth, to what I don't at all oblige you to believe; ſeeing in that World, where your Miracles are but natural Effects, this hath paſt for a real Miracle. So ſoon as theſe little men were fallen a dancing, I thought I felt their Agitation in my ſelf, and my Agitation in them. I could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that Dance, but that I was ſenſibly drawn out of my place, as by a <hi>Vortex</hi> that moved by it's own whirling, and by the particular Agitation of every one of them, all the parts of my Body were put into Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo that I felt the ſame Gayneſs fluſh in my countenance, which a like Motion had ſpread upon theirs. As the Dance cloſed more and more, the Dancers ſhuffled together, by a prompter and more imperceptible way of skipping. The deſign of the Ball ſeemed to be, to repreſent a huge Giant; for by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to one another, and redoubling the ſwiftneſs of their Motions, they ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo cloſe together, that I diſtinguiſhed no
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57769:118"/> more, but a great tranſparent <hi>Coloſſus;</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever my eyes ſaw them enter one into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. About that time, it began to be out of my power, any more to diſcern the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of their ſeveral Motions, by reaſon of their extream Volubility; and alſo becauſe that Volubility, contracting more and more, according as it approached to the Center, each vortical Trip at length, took up ſo little a ſpace, that it eſcaped my eye-ſight. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs I believe, that the parts ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached one another; for that humane Maſs, heretofore ſo hugely great, was by degrees reduced into the ſhape of a young Man, of a middle ſtature, whoſe Members were proportioned with ſo exact a Symetry, that the higheſt Idea of perfection could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reach it: He was beautiful, beyond all that the fancy of Painters could ever imagin; but that which ſeemed to me very ſtrange was, that all the parts which compleated that perfect Microcoſm, were linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the twinkling of an eye; the nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler ſort of our little Dancers cut a Capriol, to the height and natural poſture of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Head. The hotter, but leſs agile, formed the Heart; and thoſe that were much heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, furniſhed only the Bones, Fleſh, and Plumpneſs.</p>
                     <p>When that lovely big young Man, was compleatly finiſhed, though the ſpeedy
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57769:118"/> Compoſition of him, had hardly allowed me time to obſerve any interval in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; I ſaw the King of all theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of whom he was an Abridgement, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at the Mouth: Nay, it ſeemed to me, that he was drawn into that Body, by the Reſpiration of the Body it ſelf. This Pile of little Men, had not as yet given any ſign of Life; but ſo ſoon as it had ſucked in its little King, it perceived it ſelf then, to be no more but one. For ſome time he ſtood conſidering of me, and ſeeming by his looks, now acquainted with me, he drew near, careſſed me, and giving me his Hand: Now it is, ſaid he, that without wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the delicateneſs of my Lungs, I can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain thee with the things, that thou paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately deſiredſt to know: But firſt of all, it's but reaſonable, that I ſhould diſcover to thee, the hidden Secrets of our Original. Know then, that we are native Animals of the brighter Regions of the Sun; the moſt ordinary, as well as the moſt uſeful of our Employments, is to Travel over the vaſt Countries of this great World. We curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerve the Manners of People, the Genius of Climates, and the Nature of all things, that deſerve our Conſideration; by means whereof, we form to our ſelves, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Science of every thing that hath a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now thou muſt know, that my Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57769:119"/> travelled under my Conduct; and to the end, we might have time to obſerve things more curiouſly, we retained not that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Conformation of our Bodies, which cannot fall under they Senſes, and whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty would have made us make too much haſte; but we converted our ſelves into Birds; all my Subjects, by my Orders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Eagles; and as for my ſelf, leaſt they might grow weary, I Metamorphoſed my ſelf into a Nightingale, to ſweeten their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, by the Charms of Muſick: Without flying, I followed the rapid flight of my People; for I perched upon the Head of one of my Vaſſals, and we were ſtill purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Journey; when a Nightingale, an Inhabitant of a Province of the obſcure Country, that at that time we Travelled through, aſtoniſhed to ſee me in the Power of an Eagle (for it could take us for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but what it ſaw us to be) fell a bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Misfortune: I ordered my People to halt, and we lighted on the top of ſome Trees, where that Charitable Bird lamented. I took ſo much Pleaſure in the ſweetneſs of her dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Airs, that to the end I might enjoy them the longer, and with more convenience, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to undeceive her. I deviſed upon the ſpot a Story, wherein I told her the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Misfortunes, that had made me fall into the power of that Eagle: I pieced it out with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57769:119"/> ſo ſurpriſing Adventures, which ſo dexterouſly raiſed the Paſſions, and the Air was ſo well adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Letter, that the Nightingale, was quite beſide her ſelf. We reciprocally warbled to one another, the Hiſtory of our mutual Love in Muſick. I chanted in my Airs, that not only I was comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but even rejoyced in my diſaſter, ſeeing it had procured me the Glory, to be lamented in ſuch pretty Songs; and that little diſconſolate Bird anſwered me in hers, that ſhe would joyfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept all the eſteem, I put upon her; if ſhe thought, that that could make her deſerve, the Honour of dying in my place; but that Fortune, not having reſerved ſo much Glory, for ſuch a Wretch as ſhe, ſhe only accepted of that eſteem, as much as might hinder me, from being aſhamed of my Friendſhip. I made anſwer again, on my part, with all the tranſports, tenderneſs, and ſoftneſs of ſo touching a Paſſion, that I perceiv'd her, three or four times, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to die of Love, upon the Branch. The Truth is, I mingled ſo much Art, with the Sweetneſs of my Voice, and ſurprized her Ear with ſuch quaint Touches, and by ways ſo unuſual to thoſe of her Kind, that I raiſed in her pretty Soul, what Paſſion ſoever I pleaſed. In this Exerciſe, we ſpent four and twenty Hours; and I believe, we had never given over making of Love, had not our Throats denied us any more Voice. That was the only Obſtacle, that hindred us from proceeding: For perceiving, that the Pains I took, began to tear my Throat, and that I could hold out no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, without falling into a Swoon, I made her a ſign to draw near to me. The danger ſhe thought me to be in, amidſt ſo many Eagles, perſwaded her, that I called her to my aid: She came flie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57769:120"/> immediately, to my Aſſiſtance, and reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give me a Glorious Inſtance, that ſhe could for a Friend brave Death even upon his Throne, ſhe boldly lighted upon the great crooked Beak of the Eagle, where I was perched. Really, ſo ſtrong a Courage, in ſo weak a Creature, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted me, with ſome Veneration; for, grant I had implored her aid, as ſhe fancied, and that it be a Law, amongſt Animals of the ſame kind, to aſſiſt the unfortunate; yet, the Inſtinct of her timorous Nature, ought to have made her wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and nevertheleſs, ſhe boggled not in the leaſt: On the contrary, ſhe made ſo much haſte, that I cannot tell which flew firſt, the Signal, or the Nightingale. Proud, to ſee under her Feet, the Head of her Tyrant, and raviſhed, to think that for my ſake, ſhe was to be Sacrificed, almoſt under my Wings, and that ſome happy drops of her Blood, might perhaps Jert upon my Feathers, ſhe gently turned her Eyes to me, and having bid me <hi>adieu,</hi> as it were, by a Glance, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ask me leave to die; ſhe ſtruck ſo briskly her little Beak, into the Eyes of the Eagle, that they ſeemed to me to be out, before the peck was given. When my Bird perceived it ſelf to be blind, it formed to it ſelf another ſight of new. I gently rebuked the Nightingale, for her too raſh Action; and thinking it would be danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to conceal our real Being, any longer from her, I told her, who we were; but the poor lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thing, prepoſſeſſed with an Opinion, that theſe Barbarians, whoſe Priſoner I was, forced me to deviſe that Tale, gave no credit to all that I could ſay to her. When I found that all the Reaſons, whereby I thought to convince her, proved inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57769:120"/> I gave private Orders, to ten or twelve thouſand of my Subjects, and immediately, the Nightingale, perceived under her Feet, a River, running under a Boat, and the Boat floating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; the Boat was no bigger, than was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to hold me, and another of my Size. At the firſt Signal given, my Eagles flew away, and I threw my ſelf into the Skiff; from whence, I called to the Nightingale, that if ſhe could not as yet, reſolve to leave me ſo ſoon, ſhe ſhould embark with me. So ſoon as ſhe was come in, I commanded the River to take its courſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Region, whither my People flew; but the fluidity of the Water, being inferiour to that of the Air, and by conſequence, the Rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of their flight greater than that of ours, we were left a little behind. During the whole Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, I made it my Buſineſs, to undeceive my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Paſſenger; I told her, that ſhe ought not to expect any fruit of her Paſſion, ſince we were not of the ſame Kind, that ſhe might very well have perceived that, when the Eagle, whoſe Eyes ſhe had ſtruck out, framed to it ſelf new ones, in her preſence, and when at my command, twelve thouſand of my Subjects, had Metamorphoſed themſelves, into that River and Boat, which carried us. My Remonſtrances had not the leaſt Succeſs: She made me anſwer, that as for the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, who, I would have it believed, had formed to it ſelf Eyes, it had no need of them; becauſe ſhe had not ſtruck her Beak right into the Ball of its Eye; and as to the River and Boat, which I ſaid to have been begot only of a Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of my People, they were in the Wood from the Creation of the World, though they had not
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57769:121"/> been minded. Perceiving her ſo Ingenious, in deceiving her ſelf, I agreed with her, that my Vaſſals, and I, ſhould Metamorphoſe our ſelves to her view, into what ſhe pleaſed; provided, that after that, ſhe would return to her own Country. Sometime, ſhe deſired it ſhould be into a Tree; ſometime, ſhe wiſhed it might be into a Flower; ſometime into Fruit, ſometime into Metal, and ſometime into Stone. In fine, that I might at once ſatisfie all her Deſires, when we arrived at my Court, where I ordered her to expect me, we Metamorphoſed our ſelves, to the Eyes of the Nightingale, into that precious Tree, thou foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt upon the Road, of which we have juſt now abandoned the form. Now after all, that I ſee that little Bird, reſolved to return into her own Country, my Subjects, and I, are about to reſume our Figure, and the right way of our Journey: But it is but reaſonable, that I ſhould firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to thee, that we are Natives, and <hi>Aborigenes</hi> of the Sun, in the bright part thereof; for there is a very remarkable Difference, betwixt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which the Luminous Region produces, and the People of the obſcure Country. We are they, whom in the World of the Earth, ye call Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and your preſumptuous ſtupidity, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us that Name; becauſe, imagining no Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, more perfect than Man, and perceiving that ſome Creatures, perform things above Humane Power, you have taken theſe Animals for Spirits. You are miſtaken though, we are Animals as well as you: For although when we pleaſe, we give to our Matter, as you have juſt now ſeen, the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Figure, and Form of the things, into which we have a mind to transform our ſelves,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57769:121"/> that does not infer that we are Spirits. But liſten, and I'll diſcover to thee, how all theſe Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, which ſeem to thee to be ſo many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, are no more but pure natural Effects. Thou muſt know, that being born Inhabitants of the bright part of this great World, where it is the Principle of Matter to be in Action; we ought to have the Imagination, far more active, than thoſe of the obſcure Regions, and the Subſtance of Body, far more ſubtil alſo. Now this being ſuppoſed, it muſt needs be, that our Imagination meeting with no Obſtacle, in the matter that compoſes us, it diſpoſes the ſame as it pleaſes, and becoming Miſtreſs of all our Maſs, makes it by moving all its Particles, to paſs into the order, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for conſtituting that great thing, which it had formed in little. So that every one of us, having imagined the place, and part of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Tree, into which we had a mind to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and having by that effort of Imagination, excited our matter to the Motions, neceſſary for producing them, we transformed our ſelves into the ſame. Thus my Eagle, having his Eyes peckt out, had no more to do, for reſtoring of them again, but to imagine himſelf a ſharp-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eagle; for all our Transformations, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Motion; and therefore it is that, when from Leaves, Flowers, and Fruit that we were, we became tranſmuted into Men, thou ſaweſt us dance ſtill ſometime after, becauſe we were not as yet recovered from the agitation, which we ought to give to our matter, for making of us Men: After the manner of Bells; which though they be ſtopt, yet Chime for ſome time after, and dully retain the ſame
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57769:122"/> ſound, which was cauſed by the ſtriking of the Clapper; and therefore thou ſaweſt us dance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we made that great Man, becauſe for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of him, it behoved us to take all the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and particular Motions, that were neceſſary to conſtitute him; to the end that that agitation by degrees compreſſing, and compacting our ſeveral Bodies by it's motion, might create in every part the ſpecifick Motion, which it ought to have. Ye men of the other world, cannot do the ſame things, by reaſon of the Heavineſs of your Maſs, and the Coldneſs of your Imagination.</p>
                     <p>He continued his Probation, and illuſtrated it by ſo familiar and palpable Inſtances, that at length I was undeceiv'd of a great many ill prov'd opinions, wherewith our obſtinate Doctors poſſeſs the minds of the weak. At that time I began to conceive, that in reality, the imagination of theſe Solar people, which by reaſon of the Climate ought to be hotter, their Bodies for the ſame reaſon lighter, and their perſons more active (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that World, as there is in ours, no Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Center, which may divert the matter from the motion, which that Imagination ſtamps upon it:) I conceived, I ſay, that that Imagination might produce without a Miracle, all the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which it had performed. A thouſand Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of almoſt the like effects, affirmed by people of our Globe, fully perſwaded me of this <hi>Cippus</hi> K. of <hi>Italy,</hi> who having been preſent at a fight of Bulls, and his imagination all the night after, running upon Horns, found his forehead horned next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Gallus Vitius,</hi> who bent his mind, and ſo vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly excited it, to conceive the Nature of Folly; that having by an effort of Imagination, given
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57769:122"/> to his matter the ſame motions, that that matter ought to have for conſtituting Folly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Fool. King <hi>Codrus</hi> being Ptiſical, and fixing his eyes and thoughts upon the freſh looks of a young Countenance, and that florid Chearfulneſs which darted upon him, from the youthfulneſs of the Boy, exciting in his Body the motion, whereby he fancied the healthfulneſs of a young man, recovered his Health. In ſhort, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Women have made their Children, already formed in the Womb, Monſters; becauſe their imagination, that was not ſtrong enough, to give to themſelves the Figure of the Monſters, which they conceived, had force ſufficient to muſter the matter of the <hi>Faetus,</hi> that was much hotter, and more moveable than their own, into an order prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the production of theſe Monſters. Nay I was perſwaded, that when that famous Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal man of Antiquity, imagined himſelf to be a Pitcher, if his two compact and heavy matter could have followed the emotion of his Fancy, it would have formed of his entire Body a perfect Pitcher; and he would have appeared to all men to be a real Pitcher, ſo as he appeared to be to himſelf alone. A great many other Inſtances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I ſatisfied my ſelf, ſo throughly convinced me, that I made no doubt any more, of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which the Man-ſpirit told me. He asked me, if I deſired any thing elſe of him; and I thanked him with all my Heart: After that, he had ſtill the goodneſs to adviſe me, that ſince I was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of the Earth, I ſhould follow the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingale into the obſcure Regions of the Sun; becauſe they were more ſutable to the pleaſures which Human Nature covets. No ſooner had he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57769:123"/> this diſcourſe, but that opening his Mouth very wide, I ſaw the King of theſe little Animals come out of his Throat, in ſhape of a Nightingale. The great man inſtantly fell down, and at the ſame time, all his Members by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels flew away under the form of Eagles. That Nightingale ſelf-Creator, perched upon the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them, from whence he warbled out a moſt excellent Air, whereby, I fancy, he gave me the Farewel. The real Nightingale took flight alſo, but not the way as they did, nor did ſhe ſoar ſo high; ſo that I did not loſe ſight of her. We tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled much about the ſame rate; for ſeeing I was indifferent what Country I went to firſt, I was very willing to accompany her; beſides that the obſcure regions of the Birds, being more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to my Conſtitution, I hoped alſo to meet with Adventures there, more agreeable to my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. In that Expectation I travelled for the ſpace of three weeks at leaſt, with all imaginable content, had I had nothing but my ears to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; for the Nightingale let me not be without Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; when ſhe was weary, ſhe came and reſted upon my Shoulder; and when I ſtopt, ſhe ſtaid for me. At length I arrived in a Country, of the Kingdom of that little Quiriſter; who then ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no more for my Company, ſo that I loſt ſight of her. I ſought her, and called to her; but at length growing weary of running up and down in vain after her, I reſolved to take ſome reſt: For that end I laid my ſelf along upon a ſoft Carpet of Graſs, ſpread at the Root of a lofty Rock, that was covered with many trees, whoſe blith and freſh Verdure was a perfect Emblem of Youth: But whilſt ſoftened by the Charms of the place.</p>

                     <div type="subsection">
                        <p>I Began to fall aſleep in the Shade, I perceived in the Air a ſtrange Bird, that hovered over my Head; it ſupported it ſelf by ſo ſlight and imperceptible a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I was many times in doubt, whether it might not be alſo a little Univerſe, balanced by its own Center. However by little and little it deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, and at length came ſo near, that it filled my Eyes with a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Proſpect. The Tail of it ſeemed to be green, its Breaſt Azure-enamel'd, its Wings Incarnate, and its Head Purple, which toſſed a glittering Crown of Gold, the Rayes whereof ſparkled from its Eyes.</p>
                        <p>It kept a long time upon the Wing, and I was ſo attentive to obſerve what became on't, that my Soul being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and in a manner wrapt up in the ſole action of Seeing, it hardly reached my Ear, to let me hear that the Bird ſpoke as it ſung.</p>
                        <p>However, being by little and little unbent from my Extaſie, I diſtinctly remarked the Syllables, Words, and Diſcourſe which it uttered.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="98" facs="tcp:57769:124"/> To the beſt of my Memory, then it ſpun out its Song into theſe terms,</p>
                        <p>You are a Stranger, whiſtled the Bird, and has had your birth in a World, of which originally I am. Now that ſecret propenſity to mutual Love, that thoſe of the ſame Country have one for another, is the inſtinct, which Inclines me to inform you of my Life.</p>
                        <p>I perceive your mind puzled to conceive, how it is poſſible that I ſhould expreſs my ſelf to you, in a continued Diſcourſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing though Birds imitate your words, they underſtand not the meaning of them; but, on the other hand, when you coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit the Barking of a <hi>Dog,</hi> or the Note of a <hi>Nightingale,</hi> you underſtand as little what the <hi>Dog</hi> or <hi>Nightingale</hi> means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Conclude then from thence, That neither Birds nor Men are therefore the leſs rational.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs, in the ſame manner as amongſt you, there have been ſome ſo Ingenious, as to have underſtood and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our Language, as <hi>Apollonius, Thiane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Aneximander, Aeſop,</hi> and many others, whoſe names I conceal, becauſe they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came to our knowledge; ſo there are thoſe amongſt us, who underſtand and ſpeak yours. Some indeed, know only the Language of one Nation: But juſt ſo
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57769:124"/> as there are ſome Birds that ſay nothing at all, ſome that chirp, and others that ſpeak; there are alſo ſome more perfect, who can make uſe of all Idioms; as for my ſelf, I have the honour to be one of that ſmall number.</p>
                        <p>After all, you muſt know, that in what world ſoever it be, nature hath ſtamped on Birds a ſecret deſire of flying up hither; and perhaps that Emotion of our Will is, that which hath made our Wings to grow; as Women with Child imprint upon their Children, the figure of the things they have longed for; or rather as thoſe who paſſionately would learn to Swim, have been ſeen in their ſleep to jump into Rivers, and with more skill than an experienced Swimmer paſs thoſe dangers, that if they had been awake, they durſt not have ſo much as beheld; or as the Son of that ſame King
<hi>Craeſus,</hi> whom a vehement deſire of ſpeaking, to ſave his Father's Life, taught a Language all of a ſudden; or in ſhort, as that Ancient who being purſued by his Enemy, and ſurpriſed without Arms, had Bulls Horns grow out on his Fore-head, through the deſire that a Rage, not unlike to that of that Beaſt, inſpired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
                        <p>When Birds then arrive in the Sun, they go and aſſociate themſelves to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57769:125"/> of their kind. I well perceive, you are big with expectation to learn what I am, it is I who amongſt you am called a
<hi>Phenix,</hi> in every world there is but one at a time, which lives there for the ſpace of an hundred Years; for at the end of an Age, when upon ſome Mountain of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> it hath laid a great Egg amidſt the Coals of its Funeral Pile, which it hath made of the Branches of Aloes, Cinnamon and Frankincenſe, it takes its flight, and diverts its courſe towards the Sun, as the Country to which its heart hath long aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired. It hath indeed made many At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts before, for accompliſhing that Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; but the weight of its Egg, which hath ſo thick a ſhell, that it requires an Age to be hatched in, ſtill retarded the Enterpriſe.</p>
                        <p>I am ſenſible, that you can hardly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that miraculous Production; and therefore I'll explain it to you. The
<hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix</hi> is an Hermaprodite, but amongſt Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphrodites, it is likewiſe another <hi>Phenix</hi> altogether extraordinary: For—</p>
                        <p>It continued half a quarter of an hour without ſpeaking, and then added: I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you ſuſpect what I have told you to be falſe, but if what I ſay be not true, the firſt time I come into your Globe, may an Eagle devour me.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="101" facs="tcp:57769:125"/> It remained a little while longer hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Wing, and then flew away.</p>
                        <p>The Admiration that its relation put me into, gave me the Curioſity to follow it; and becauſe it cut the Welkin with no ſwift flight, I eaſily kept within ſight of it.</p>
                        <p>At the end of Fifty Leagues, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, I found my ſelf in a Country ſo full of Birds, that their number equalled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the number of the leaves that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them. The thing that ſurpriſed me moſt was, that in ſtead of growing wilder upon my coming, they flew about me, one chirped into my Ears, another fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a compaſs about my head: In ſhort, when their Gambols had for a long time taken up my attention, all of a ſudden I felt my Arms loaded with above a Million of all ſorts and kinds, which preſſed them down ſo heavily, that I could not move them.</p>
                        <p>They held me in this poſture, until I ſaw Four great Eagles come, of which Two having with their Talons taken faſt hold on me by the Legs, and the other Two by the Arms, they carried me up aloft in the Air.</p>
                        <p>Amongſt the Wood I ſpied a Magpy, that made a great buſtle flying up and down; and I heard her call to me, that I
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57769:126"/> ſhould not make reſiſtance, becauſe her Companions were already conſulting to put out my Eyes. This admonition put a ſtop to all the Strugling that I could have made; ſo that theſe Eagles carried me above a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Leagues from thence into a great Wood, which was (as the Magpy told me) the City where their King held his Reſidence.</p>
                        <p>The firſt thing they did, was to throw me into Priſon, in the hollow Trunk of a large Oak; and a great many of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perched upon the Branches, where they performed the duty of a Company of Souldiers ſtanding to their Arms.</p>
                        <p>About the end of Four and twenty hours, another Company mounted the Guard, and relieved theſe. In the mean time, whilſt I waited with a great deal of Melancholy, to know what it would pleaſe Fortune to determine of me; amidſt my Misfortunes my charitable Magpy informed me of all that paſt.</p>
                        <p>Amongſt other things, I remember ſhe told me, That the Mobile of the Birds, had made a heavy Rout, becauſe they had kept me ſo long without devouring me; that they had alledged I would grow ſo lean, that there would be nothing of me left but Bones to pick.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="123" facs="tcp:57769:126"/> The Clamor was like to break out into a Sedition; for my Magpy having taken the boldneſs to repreſent, That it was a barbarous Procedure to put to death in that manner without any Tryal, an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, which in ſome ſort had Reaſon as well as they; they had like to have torn her to pieces, pretending that it would be very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, to think that an Animal ſtark naked, which Nature her ſelf, when ſhe produced it, took no care to furniſh with things neceſſary for its Preſervation, ſhould be capable of Reaſon like them: Nay more, added they, were it an Animal that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled our ſhape ſomewhat more, it were ſomewhat; but of all things the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and moſt hideous. In a word, a bald Beaſt, a featherleſs Bird, a Chimera patched up of all ſorts of Natures, and terrible to all. Man, I ſay, ſo vain and fooliſh, that he perſwades himſelf, we were only made for him. Man, who with his ſharp-ſighted Soul, cannot diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Sugar from Arſenick, and who'll ſwallow down Hemlock, when his quaint Judgment hath made him take it for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley. Man, who maintains that there is no Reaſoning, but with a reference to the Senſes; and yet has the weakeſt, dulleſt and moſt erring Senſes of all Creatures living. Man, in fine, whom Nature hath
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57769:127"/> formed as ſhe doth Monſters, to ſhew her skill; and yet hath filled with the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of domineering over, and extirpating all other Animals.</p>
                        <p>This was the diſcourſe that the wiſer ſort held; as for the Rabble they cried, That it was a horrid thing, to believe that a Beaſt who had not a Face like theirs, ſhould have Reaſon. Now, chattered they one to another, he hath neither Beak, Feathers nor Claws, and can he have a Spiritual Soul? Strange! what Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is that!</p>
                        <p>Though the more generous pittyed me, yet that hindered not, but that an Indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was brought in againſt me; all the Writings were drawn upon the Bark of a Cypreſs Tree: And then ſome Days after, I was carried before the Tribunal of Birds. There were none choſen for Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, Counſellors and Judges of the Court, but Magpys, Jays, and Starlings; becauſe they would have none but thoſe that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood my Language. Inſtead of trying me at the Bar, they ſet me ſtradling upon a Stump of a rotten Tree; where he that was Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Court, having chattered two or three times with his Beak, and Majeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſhrugged his Feathers, asked me, From whence I came, of what nation and kind I was? My charitable Magpy had given
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57769:127"/> me ſome Inſtructions before, which were very uſeful to me; and amongſt other, that I ſhould have a ſpecial care, not to confeſs that I was a Man. I made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer then, That I was of that little World which is called the Earth, that the Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix, and ſome others whom I ſaw in Court, might have told them of: That the Climat where I was born, lay under the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Zone of the Artick Pole, in the utmoſt part of
<hi>Europe,</hi> which was called <hi>France;</hi> and that as to my kind, I was not a Man, as they imagined, but an Ape: That ſome Men had carried me away very young out of the Cradle, and brought me up amongſt them: That their bad Breeding had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my skin ſo delicate; that they made me forget my Mother's Tongue, and taught me theirs: That to comply with theſe Wild Animals, I had accuſtomed my ſelf to walk only on two Legs: And that, in a word, ſince it is more eaſie to degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate than to improve in kind, the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Cuſtom, and Food of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Beaſts, had ſo much power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, that hardly my Parents, who are Apes of Quality, could themſelves know me. I added for my Juſtification, that they might have me viewed by expert Birds, and that in caſe they found me to be a Man, I ſhould be willing to be annihilated as a Monſter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="106" facs="tcp:57769:128"/> Gentlemen, cried a Swallow of the Court, ſo ſoon as I had made an end, I hold him as convicted: You have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got that juſt now he ſaid, That the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where he was born, was <hi>France;</hi> but you know that the Apes in <hi>France</hi> do not engender: Judge now after that, if he be what he boaſts himſelf to be.</p>
                        <p>I made anſwer to my Accuſer, That I was carried away ſo young out of the Boſom of my Parents, and Tranſported into
<hi>France,</hi> that I had reaſon to call that my native Country which I remembred beſt.</p>
                        <p>That reaſon though ſpecious, was not ſufficient; but the moſt part being raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hear, that I was not a Man, were very willing to believe it ſo: For thoſe who had never ſeen any, could not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but that a Man was a far more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Creature, than I appeared to be to them; and the diſcreeter added, That a Man was ſo abominable a thing, that it were good they ſhould believe him to be only an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Being.</p>
                        <p>All the Court clapt their Wings for Joy, and immediatly I was commited to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen-Birds to be examined, on condition they ſhould preſent me again next Morning, and at the opening of the Court, make report of the Verdict of the Jury. They undertook the Affair then, and carried me
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57769:128"/> into a Bye-copice: Whilſt they kept me there, they did nothing but play a hundred Monkey tricks about me; ſometimes they knocked their Feet one againſt another, by and by they dug little Holes, only that they might fill them up again; and then all of a ſudden I was amazed that I could ſee no Body at all.</p>
                        <p>The Day and Night were ſpent in theſe trifles, until next Morning, that the hour appointed being come, they brought me to appear again before my Judges: Where my Syndicks being deſired to tell the truth, anſwered, That to diſcharge their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, they thought themſelves obliged to inform the Court, That for certain I was not an Ape, as I bragg'd: For, ſaid they, it was to no purpoſe for us to leap, skip, whirl round, and invent before him a hundred odd Tricks and Capers, whereby we thought to move him to do the like, according to the cuſtom of Apes, when all would not do. Now though he hath been bred amongſt Men, ſeeing an Ape is always an Ape, we maintain that it could not have been in his power, to refrain from imitating our Apiſh Tricks. This, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, is our Report.</p>
                        <p>The Judges at that drew near to give their Opinions; but they perceived that the Sky was overcaſt and charged with
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57769:129"/> Clouds, which made them break up the Court.</p>
                        <p>I imagined that the appearance of bad Weather inclined them to do ſo.</p>
                        <p>When the Attorney-General by order of Court came, and gave me intimation, That they would not paſs Sentence on me that Day; that they never determined a criminal Proceſs, when the Sky was not ſerene; becauſe they were afraid, that the bad temper of the Air, might work ſome alteration in the good Conſtitution of the minds of the Judges; that the peeviſh temper the Birds are in, during Rain, might influence the Cauſe: Or, in a word, that the Court might revenge their Sadneſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Priſoner; and therefore it was, that my Sentence was deferr'd till fairer Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I was carried back to Priſon then, and I remember that in the way my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Magpy never forſook me; ſhe kept flying all along by my ſide, and I believe ſhe would never have left me, had not her Companions drawn near to us.</p>
                        <p>At length I arrived at the place of my Priſon, where, during, my Captivity, I had no other Food but the King's Bread; for ſo they call half a hundred Worms, and as many Maggots, that every ſeven hours they brought me to eat.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="109" facs="tcp:57769:129"/> I thought that I ſhould have appeared again next day, and every Body thought ſo too; but one of my Keepers told me, at the end of five or ſix Days, that all that time had been employed, in rendring Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to a Society of Gold-finches, who had complained of one of their number. I asked my Keeper, What crime that poor Wretch had been accuſed of? Of the moſt enormous, replied my Keeper, that a Bird can be aſperſed with. They accuſe it— can you believe it? They accuſe it— but good Gods! the very thoughts of it makes my Feathers to ſtand an end! In a word, they accuſe it, that during the ſpace of Six Years, it hath not as yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to have a Friend; and therefore it hath been condemned to be a King, and a King of a People that differ from it in kind.</p>
                        <p>Had its Subjects been of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it might at leaſt have beguiled its Eyes and Deſire with their Pleaſures: But ſeeing the pleaſures of one kind, have no relation to thoſe of another, it will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port all the fatigues, and taſt all the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Royalty, and never be able to reliſh the pleaſures thereof in the leaſt.</p>
                        <p>They have ſent it away this Morning, accompanied with a great many Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to take heed that it do not poiſon it ſelf by the way.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="110" facs="tcp:57769:130"/> Though my Keeper was naturally a great Talker, yet he durſt not entertain me any longer in diſcourſe, for fear of being ſuſpected of Intelligence with me.</p>
                        <p>About the end of the Week, I was again brought before my Judges.</p>
                        <p>They reſted me upon the breech of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Tree without Leaves.</p>
                        <p>All the Birds of the Long-Robe, as well Advocates, Counſellors, as Judges, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents, rooſted by Stories, every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Dignity, on the Top of a tall Cedar: For the reſt who were only preſent out of Curioſity, they placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves promiſcuouſly till all the Seats were full, that's to ſay, till the Branches of the Cedar were covered with Feet.</p>
                        <p>The Magpy, in whom I obſerved all along ſo much Compaſſion for me, came and perched upon my Tree, where pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to divert her ſelf by pecking the Moſs: Really, ſaid ſhe to me, you cannot believe how much I am concerned at your Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; for though I am not ignorant that amongſt the Living, a Man is a Plague, that ought to be purged out of all well-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd States; yet when I call to mind, that I was bred amongſt them from the Cradle, that I have learned their Language ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, that I had almoſt forgot mine own; and that. I have eaten out of their Hands
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57769:130"/> ſuch excellent Green Cheeſe, I cannot think on't, but that it brings Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Eyes and Mouth; I have ſo great a kindneſs for you, that I cannot incline to the right ſide.</p>
                        <p>She had gone on ſo far, when we were interrupted by the coming of an Eagle, that lighted amongſt the Branches of a Tree, pretty near to mine. I was about to have riſen and fallen upon my knees before the Eagle, thinking he had been the King, if my Magpy with her Foot had not held me faſt in my Seat. Did you think, ſaid ſhe, that that great Eagle had been our Sovereign? That's an Imagination of you Men, who becauſe you ſuffer your ſelves to be commanded by the greateſt, the ſtrongeſt, and the moſt cruel of your Companions, have fooliſhly thought, judging of all things according to your own meaſures, that the Eagle ought to command us.</p>
                        <p>But our Politicks are quite different, for we never chuſe for our Kings, but the Weakeſt, the Wildeſt, and moſt Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: Nay, and we change them every Six Months, and pitch upon the Weak, to the end, that the meaneſt amongſt us, who may have been wronged by him, may take his Revenge. We chuſe the Mild, to the end he neither hate, or be hated of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57769:131"/> any Body; and we would have him to be of a Peaceful Temper, for avoiding of War, the Sink of all Injuſtice.</p>
                        <p>Once every Week he holds a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where all are received to propoſe their Grievances againſt him. If there be but three Birds only diſſatisfied with his Government, out he goes, and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a new Election.</p>
                        <p>All that Day the Parliament ſits, our King is mounted on the top of a high Yew-Tree, upon the brink of a Lake, bound Feet and Wings. All the Birds one after another paſs before him; and if any of them know him to be guilty of a Crime that deſerves death, he may throw him into the Water; but he muſt upon the ſpot, juſtifie the fact by good Reaſons, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he is Condemned to the ſaid Death.</p>
                        <p>I could not forbear to interrupt, and ask her, what ſhe meant by the ſaid Death? And this is the Anſwer ſhe made me:</p>
                        <p>When the Crime of a Malefactor is judged to be ſo enormous, that an ordinary Death is not ſufficient to expiate it, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to chuſe one that contains the pain of many; and in this manner they proceed to it:</p>
                        <p>Thoſe amongſt us that have the moſt melancholick and doleful Tone, are ſent
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57769:131"/> to the Malefactor, who is carried upon a diſmal Cypreſs. There theſe ſad Muſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans gather about him, and by the Ear fill his Soul with ſuch tragical and doleful Notes, that the bitterneſs of his Sorrow diſordering the Oeconomy of his Organs, and preſſing his Heart, he pines away to the ſight, and dies choaked with Sadneſs.</p>
                        <p>However ſuch a ſpectacle never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens; for ſeeing our Kings are exceeding mild, they never force any Body to incur ſo cruel a Death, upon the account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
                        <p>He that at preſent Reigns is a Dove, who is of ſo peaceable a temper, that t'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, when two Sparrows were to be made Friends, it was the hardeſt thing in the World, to make him conceive what Enmity was.</p>
                        <p>My Magpy could not continue ſo long a diſcourſe, without being obſerved by ſome of the By-ſtanders; and becauſe ſhe was already ſuſpected of ſome Intelligence with me, the chief of the Aſſembly made one of the Eagles of my guard, catch her by the Neck, and make ſure of her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. King Dove arrived in the mean while; all were ſilent, and the firſt thing that was heard, was the complaint of the great Cenſor of the Birds, which he made againſt the Magpy. The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57769:132"/> fully informed of the Scandal ſhe had given, asked her her Name, and how ſhe came to know me? Sir, anſwered ſhe, all in amaze, My name is <hi>Magget,</hi> there are here a great many Birds of Quality, that will vouch for me. One day in the World of the Earth, of which I am a Native, I was informed by <hi>Chirpper</hi> the Poſy there, (who having heard me cry in my Cage, came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit me at the Window where I hung,) that my Father was
<hi>Bobb-tail,</hi> and my Mother <hi>Crack-nuts:</hi> I had not known ſo much but for him; for I was carried away very Young, from under the Wings of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; my Mother ſome time after died of Grief; and my Father, being then paſt the Age of having any more Children, deſpairing to ſee himſelf without Heirs, went to the War of the Jays, where he was killed by a peck in the brain. They that carried me away were certain wild Animals, whom they call Hog-herds; who had me to be ſold at a Caſtle, where I ſaw that Man who now ſtands upon his Tryal. I cannot tell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he conceived any Kindneſs for me, but he took the pains to cauſe the Servants to cut meat for me; he had ſometimes the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to prepare it for me himſelf. If I catcht cold in the Winter, he carried me to the Fire, lined my Cage, or ordered the Gardiner to warm me in his Boſom.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57769:132"/> The Servants durſt not vex me in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: and one day I remember, he ſaved me from the Jaws of the Cat, who held me in her Paws, to which my Lady's little Page had expoſed me; but it will not be impertinent, to tell you the Cauſe of that Barbarity. To comply with
<hi>Verdelet</hi> (for that was the Page's name,) I was chatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one day ſome idle words that he had taught me. Now it happened, as ill Luck would have it, though I always repeated my Leſſons in courſe, that I came to ſay in order, juſt as he came in to deliver a Meſſage, <hi>Be quiet, you Son of a Whore, you lye.</hi> The Man there that ſtands Indicted, who knowing the Rogue to be naturally given to Lying, imagined, that I might very well have ſpoken by Prophecy, and ſent to the place to know, if
<hi>Verdelet</hi> had been there: <hi>Verdelet</hi> was convinced of his Knavery, <hi>Verdelet</hi> was whipt, and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delet</hi> in revenge, would have had me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by <hi>Maulkin.</hi> The King by a Nod of the head ſhew'd, that he was ſatisfied with the Pity that ſhe had conceived for my diſaſter: However he diſcharged her to ſpeak any more to me in private. Then he asked my Adverſary's Council, if his Plea was ready? He made a ſign with his Foot, that he was going to ſpeak, and if I miſtake it not, theſe are
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57769:133"/> the Points whereon he inſiſted againſt me:</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="subsection">
                        <head>The Plea brought in the Parliament of Birds, Aſſembled against an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, accuſed of being a Man.</head>
                        <p>Gentlemen, The Plaintiff is <hi>Guillemot</hi> the Fleſhy, a Partridge by extraction, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrived from the World of the Earth, his Breaſt ſtill gaping by a ſhot that he hath received from Men; Demandant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Mankind, and by conſequence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an Animal, whom I pretend to be a member of that great Body. It would be no hard matter for us, to hinder, by his death, the Violences that he can commit: Nevertheleſs, ſeeing the Preſervation or Loſs of every thing that has breath, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Common-Wealth of the Living, I think we ſhould deſerve to have been made Men, that's to ſay, Degraded from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Immortality, which we enjoy above them, had we reſembled them in any unjuſt Action like theirs.</p>
                        <p>Let us examine then, Gentlemen, the Difficulties of this Cauſe, with all the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication that our divine minds are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of.</p>
                        <p>The ſtreſs of the matter lies here, to wit, Whether or not this Animal be a Man?
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57769:133"/> and then in caſe we make it out, that he is, whether or not he deſerves Death for that?</p>
                        <p>For my part, I make no doubt but that he is; in the firſt place, Becauſe he is ſo impudent as to tell a Lye, in maintaining that he is not; in the ſecond place, Becauſe he laughs like a Fool; thirdly, In that he weeps like a Sot; fourthly, In that he blows his Noſe like a naſty Villain; fifthly, In that he is Feathered but in part; ſixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, In that he carries his Tail before; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, In that he hath always a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny little ſquare Bones in his Mouth, which he has neither the wit to ſpit out, nor ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low down; eighthly and laſtly, Becauſe every Morning he lifts up his Eyes, his Noſe, and large Snout, claps his open Hands cloſe together, which he points up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, joins them into one piece, as if it troubled him to have two at liberty; breaks his Legs ſhort off by the middle, ſo that he falls upon his Geegots; and then by Magical words that he mutters, I have obſerved, That his broken Legs are knit again, and that he riſes up as gay as he was before. Now, you know, Gentlemen, that amongſt all Animals, none but Man has ſo black a Soul, as to be given to Magick, and by conſequence I conclude, That this is a Man: We are
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57769:134"/> now to enquire, whether or not, as Man, he deſerves to be put to death.</p>
                        <p>I think, Gentlemen, it never was yet doubted, but that all Creatures are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by our common Mother, to live together in Society. Now if I prove, that Man ſeems to be Born only to break it; ſhall I not make it out, that he going con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the end of his Creation, deſerves that Nature ſhould repent her ſelf of her work?</p>
                        <p>The firſt and fundamental Law, for the maintenance of a Republick, is Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: But Man cannot endure it to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; he falls upon us that he may eat us; he perſwades himſelf that we were only made for his uſe; he makes the Barbarity, wherewith he maſſacres us, and the ſmall Reſiſtance he finds on our ſide, an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his pretended Superiority: And nevertheleſs wo'nt own Eagles, Condores, and Griffins, who are too hard for the ſtrongeſt Man, to be his Maſters.</p>
                        <p>But why ſhould that great Size, and conformation of Members, make the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Kind, ſeeing there are Dwarffs and Giants to be found amongſt Men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
                        <p>Nay more, that Empire wherewith they flatter themſelves, is but an imaginary Right: On the contrary, they are ſo incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57769:134"/> to Servitude, that leaſt they ſhould not ſerve, they fell one another for Slaves. In this manner, the Young are Slaves to the Old, the Poor to the Rich, the Clowns to the Gentlemen, the Princes to the Monarchs, and the Monarchs themſelves to the Laws which they have Eſtabliſhed. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all that, the poor Drudges are ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to be without Maſters, that as if they apprehended, that Liberty might come to them from ſome unexpected place; they frame to themſelves Gods in all parts, in the Water, in the Air, in the Fire, and under the Earth; they'll make them of Wood, rather than want; nay, I fancy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that they tickle themſelves with the vain hopes of Immortality, not ſo much out of a Horrour, that they have of being annihilated, as for fear that they may have none to command them after their death. Here's the fine effect of that fantaſtical Monarchy, and of that natural Empire of Man, as they would have it, over the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, nay and over us too; for he has been ſo inſolent, as even to pretend to that. In the mean while, in conſequence of that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Principality, he fairly takes to himſelf the power of Life and Death over us; he lays ſnares for us, chains us, claps us up in Priſon, kills us, eats us; and makes the power of killing thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57769:135"/> free, a mark of Nobility: He thinks that the Sun is lighted on purpoſe to let him ſee how to make War againſt us; that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath only ſuffered us to take our turns in the Air, that from our flight he may draw lucky or unlucky Auſpices; and that when God put Entrails into our Bodies, his intention only was, to make a great Book, wherein Man might learn the Science of future Contingencies.</p>
                        <p>Good, then, is not this unſupportable Pride? Could any that's guilty of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a leſs puniſhment, than to be made a Man? However, I don't inſiſt upon this as a reaſon, why ye ſhould condemn this Man: The poor Beaſt wanting the uſe of Reaſon that we have, I excuſe thoſe errors of his, that proceed from want of Judgment; but for ſuch as are only the Daughters of his Will, I demand Juſtice. For inſtance, in that he kills us, though we do not attack him; in that he eats us, when he may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his hunger with more convenient Food; and what I eſteem the baſeſt of all, in that he debauches the good nature of ſome of our Brethren, as of Lanners, Faulcons and Vultures, by teaching them to murder thoſe of their kind, and to feed on their fellow Creatures alive; or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us up into his clutches.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="121" facs="tcp:57769:135"/> That alone is ſo preſſing a Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I beg the Court he may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched by the ſad Death.</p>
                        <p>The whole Bench ſhivered for horror at ſo terrible a Puniſhment; and therefore that they might have ground to moderate it, the King made a Sign to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that was aſſigned me, to anſwer.</p>
                        <p>This was a Starling, and a great Lawyer, who having three times ſtampt with his Foot, upon the Branch he ſat on, ſpake to the Court in this manner:</p>
                        <p>It is true, Gentlemen, that moved with Pity, I undertook the defence of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Beaſt; but juſt as I was about to Plead, I felt a remorſe of Conſcience, and, as it were, a ſecret Voice, that hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden me to fulfil ſo deteſtable a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So that, Gentlemen, I declare to you, and the whole Court, That for the Salvation of my Soul, I'll not contribute in any manner, to the preſervation of ſuch a Monſter, as Man is.</p>
                        <p>The whole Mobile clacked with the Beak, in ſign of Joy, and to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Sincerity of ſo Conſcientious a Bird.</p>
                        <p>My Magpy offered to Plead for me in place of the other, for it was impoſſible for her to be heard; becauſe that being bred amongſt Men, and perhaps, infected with
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57769:136"/> their Morality; it was to be feared, that ſhe would manage the Cauſe, with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicated Mind; for the Court of Birds, never ſuffer a Lawyer, that concerns himſelf more for the one Client, than for the other, to be heard; unleſs he make it appear, That that Inclination proceeds from the Parties being in the Right.</p>
                        <p>When my Judges ſaw, that no Body ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in my defence, they ſtretched out and ſhook their Wings, and immediately flew to Voting.</p>
                        <p>The greateſt part, as I was informed fince, inſiſted hard, that I ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched by the ſad Death; but neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, when they perceived that the King inclined to Clemency, all joined with him in Opinion. Thus my Judges moderated themſelves, and inſtead of the ſad Death, which they excuſed me from, they thought it convenient, that my Puniſhment might quadrate with ſome of my Crimes, and I deſtroyed by a Death, which might ſerve to undeceive me, of that pretended Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Man, over the Birds, which I bragg'd of, that I ſhould be abandoned to the weakeſt of thoſe that are carried by Wings; my meaning is, That they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned me to be eaten up by Flies.</p>
                        <p>At the ſame time the Court broke up, and I heard a whiſper, that they had not
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57769:136"/> enlarged in Specifying the particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of my Tragedy, becauſe of an accident that happened to a Bird, who juſt as he was about to ſpeak to the King, had fallen into a ſwoon. It was thought to have been occaſioned, by the Horrour that had ſeized him, in looking too ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly upon a Man: And therefore I was ordered to be carried away.</p>
                        <p>But my Sentence was pronounced firſt; and as ſoon as the Oſpray, which officiated as Clerk to the Aſſiſes, had made an end of reading it to me, I perceived all about the Sky blackened with Flies, Drones, Bees, Gnats and Muskettoes, which hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for impatience.</p>
                        <p>I expected that my Eagles ſhould have come and carried me away after the uſual manner; but in place of them a great black Oſtridge came, that ignominiouſly ſet me ſtradling upon his back; for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, that's the moſt diſgraceful poſture a Malefactor can be put into; and no Bird for what offence ſoever, can be Condemned to it.</p>
                        <p>The Officers that waited on me to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, were half a hundred Condores, and as many Griffins in the van; after whom came flying ſoftly, a proceſſion of Ravens, that croaked I know not what mournful Ditty; and I fancy that I heard
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57769:137"/> as at a greater diſtance, a Chorus of Owls, that anſwered them.</p>
                        <p>As we parted from the place where I had received Sentence, Two Birds of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, who had orders to aſſiſt me at my Death, came and ſat on my Shoulders.</p>
                        <p>Though my Soul, at that time, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heavy and diſcompoſed, by reaſon of the lamentable Condition I was in; yet I remember, in a manner, all the Reaſons they made uſe of to comfort me.</p>
                        <p>Death, ſaid they to me, (putting their Beak to my Far,) without doubt is no great Evil, ſeeing Nature our good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubjects all her Children unto it; and it ought not to be a matter of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, ſince it happens at all times, and for the leaſt things: For if Life were ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, it would not be in our power, not to give it; or if Death were atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by conſequences of Importance, as thou imagineſt, it would not be in our power to give it: There is a great deal of appearance to the contrary, ſeeing the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal begins by play, and ends at the ſame rate. I ſpeak to thee in this manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy Soul not being immortal as ours is, thou mayeſt very well conclude, That when thou dieſt, all dies with thee. Let it not trouble thee then, that thou doeſt a little ſooner, what ſome of thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57769:137"/> will do e're it be long: Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is more deplorable than thine; for if Death be an evil, it is only Evil to thoſe who are to die: And in reſpect of thee, who haſt not above an hour betwixt here and there; they ſhall be Fifty or Sixty Years in a ſtate of dying; and beſides, mind me, he that is not born is not unhappy. Now thou art going to be like him that is not born: In a twinkling of an Eye, when thou art out of this Life, thou ſhalt be what thou waſt a twinkling of an Eye before; and that twinkling of an Eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, thou ſhalt be as long dead, as he that died a Thouſand Ages ago: But make the worſt on't; ſuppoſe Life be a Bleſſing, the ſame Accident, that in the infinite ſpaces of time hath made thee to be; may it not ſome time or other, make thee once more to be again? Matter, which by various mixtures, arrived at length to that Number, Diſpoſition and Order, neceſſary for the Conſtruction of thy Being; may it not, by mixing again of new, attain to a Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requiſite for bringing thee once more again into Being? Yes, it may; but thou'lt ſay to me, I ſhall not remember that I have been. Ha! dear Brother, what does that concern thee, provided thou findeſt thy ſelf in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? And then may it not be, that to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thee for the loſs of thy Life, thou'lt
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57769:138"/> imagine the ſame Reaſons which I at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent propoſe to thee?</p>
                        <p>Theſe conſiderations are weighty enough to make thee patiently drink that bitter Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet I have others more preſſing ſtill, which will without doubt incline thee to wiſh for it. Thou muſt be perſwaded, Brother, that as thou and the reſt of Brutes are material, and that as Death, inſtead of annihilating Matter, does only trouble the Oeconomy thereof; ſo thou oughteſt, I ſay, certainly to believe, that ceaſing to be what now thou art, thou'lt begin to be ſomething elſe. Grant then, that thou only become a clod of Earth, or a Pibble, thou'lt ſtill be ſomewhat leſs wicked than Man. But I have a Secret to diſcover to thee, which I would not any of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions ſhould hear from my Mouth, and that is, That being Eaten, as thou art going to be, by our little Birds, thou'lt paſs into their Subſtance; yes, thou'lt have the honour to contribute, though blindly, to the Intellectual operations of our Flyes, and ſhare of this Glory, that if thou rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneſt not thy ſelf, thou'lt make them at leaſt to reaſon.</p>
                        <p>About this part of the Exhortation, we arrived at the place appointed for my Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="127" facs="tcp:57769:138"/> There were Four Trees very near, and in a manner equally diſtant one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on every one of which at a paralel height, a great Heron perched. They took me down from the Black Oſtridge, and a great many Cormorants lifted me up to the place where the Herons were. Theſe Birds being oppoſite to one another, and firmly perched on their ſeveral Trees, with their prodigious long Necks, as with a Cord, twiſted about me, the one about my Arms, the other about my Legs, and bound me ſo faſt, that though every one of theſe members was only tied by a ſingle Neck, yet it was not in my power, to wag or ſtir in the leaſt.</p>
                        <p>They were to continue a long while in that poſture; for I heard orders given to thoſe Cormorants that lifted me up, to go and fiſh for the Herons, and to ſlide their Foot into their Beaks.</p>
                        <p>The Flies were ſtill expected, becauſe they could not fly ſo faſt as we had done; however it was not very long before they were heard.</p>
                        <p>The firſt thing they exploited, was to diſtribute my Body among them into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Provinces; and that Diſtribution was ſo maliciouſly made, that my Eyes were aſſigned to the Bees, to the end they might Sting them out as they fed on them;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57769:139"/> my Ears to the Beetles and Drones, that they might ſtum and devour them at the ſame time; my Shoulders to the Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes, to the end, they might make me itch with their Bitings; and ſo of the reſt. No ſooner had I heard them ſettle their Orders, but that immediately I ſaw them approach. All the Atoms and Motes in the Sun, ſeemed to be converted into Flies; for ſcarcely was I viſited with two or three faint Beams of Light, that ſeemed by ſtealth to reach me, ſo cloſe were theſe Battalions, and ſo near my Fleſh.</p>
                        <p>But as every one of them was greedily chuſing the place where he was to bite, I perceived them to recoyle briskly all of a ſudden; and amidſt the confuſion of an infinite number of Shouts, that made the Clouds reſound again; I ſeveral times diſtinguiſhed the word Pardon, Pardon, Pardon.</p>
                        <p>Afterward Two Turtle Doves drew near to me; at their approach, all the ghaſtly Preparatives for my Death were diſſipated: I felt my Herons let looſe the twiſts of their long Necks, wherewith I was begirt, and my Body extended in form of a St. <hi>Andrew's</hi>-croſs, ſlide from the Top of the Four Trees, down to their very Roots.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="129" facs="tcp:57769:139"/> I expected no leſs from my fall, than to be bruiſed by ſome Stone in the Ground; but when my fear was over, I was not a little ſurpriſed, to find my ſelf decently ſeated upon a White Oſtridge, who fell a galloping, ſo ſoon as he felt me upon his Back.</p>
                        <p>They made me take another way, than the way I came; for I remember that I croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great Wood of Myrtles, and another of Turpentine Trees, adjoining to a vaſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Olive Trees, where King Dove in the middle of his Court ſtaid for me.</p>
                        <p>So ſoon as he perceived me, he gave a ſign that they ſhould help me to get down. Immediately Two Eagles of the Guard, gave me their Talons, and carried me to their Prince.</p>
                        <p>I would in honour, have embraced and kiſſed his Majeſty's little Claws, but he drew back: And I ask you the queſtion, ſaid he firſt, If you know that Bird?</p>
                        <p>At theſe words they ſhewed me a Parrot, who began to turn round and clap his Wings, when he perceived that I conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him: Yes, I fancy, cried I to the King, that I have ſeen him ſomewhere; but Fear and Joy have ſo confounded my Memory, that I cannot as yet call diſtinctly to mind, where it has been.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="130" facs="tcp:57769:140"/> With that the Parrot came, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing my Face with its Wings, ſaid to me, How! do'nt you know <hi>Caeſar,</hi> then, your Couſins Parrot, which hath ſo often given you the occaſion, to maintain that Birds uſed Reaſon? It is I who juſt now had a mind, after your Tryal was over, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the obligations I have to you; but grief to ſee you in ſo great danger, made me fall into a Swoon. His diſcourſe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened my Eyes, and having known him perfectly, I embraced and kiſſed him, and he embraced and kiſſed me. Is it thee, then ſaid I, my poor
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> whoſe Cage I opened to give thee thy Liberty, that the Tyrannical Cuſtom of our World deprived thee of?</p>
                        <p>The King interrupted our Careſſes, and ſpoke to me in this manner: Man, with us a good Action is never loſt; and therefore it is that, tho as being a Man, thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveſt to die, only becauſe thou waſt Born, yet the Senate gives thee thy Life. It's fit we ſhould thus acknowledge thoſe Notices, wherewith Nature enlightened thine Inſtinct, when it gave thee a Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſt of that Reaſon in us, which thou waſt not capable of underſtanding. Go then in Peace, and live Joyfully.</p>
                        <p>He gave ſome orders in private, and my White Oſtridge, conducted by the Two
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57769:140"/> Turtle Doves, carried me out of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
                        <p>My Bird having galloped with me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twelve hours, left me near to a Foreſt, into which I went ſo ſoon as it was gone. There I began to taſt the Pleaſure of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and of feeding on the Honey, which diſtilled down the Bark of the Trees.</p>
                        <p>I fancy that I ſhould never have made an end of my Walk, (for the agreable Varieties of the place, preſented always ſome new thing more delightful to my Eyes,) had my Body been able to hold out: But ſeeing I found my ſelf at length wholly overcome with Weariſomneſs, I ſoftly laid my ſelf down upon the Graſs.</p>
                        <p>Lying thus ſtretched out under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Trees, I found my ſelf invited to Sleep, by the freſh Air and Solitude of the Place; when a humming noiſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Voices, which ſeemed to ſound about my Ears, made me awake with a ſtart.</p>
                        <p>The ground appeared to be very level and ſmooth, without the leaſt Buſh that might intercept the Sight; and therefore my Proſpect reached far amongſt the Trees of the Foreſt. Nevertheleſs, the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murring that I heard, could not be but very near me; ſo that liſtning to it more attentively, I very diſtinctly heard a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57769:141"/> of <hi>Greek</hi> Words; and amongſt ſeveral that diſcourſed together, one who ſpake to this purpoſe,</p>
                        <p>Doctor, one of my Allies, <hi>Elm</hi> with Three Heads, hath juſt now ſent me a Chaffinch, to acquaint me that he is Sick of an Hectick Feaver, and of a Scurffy Moſs, wherewith he is covered from Head to Foot. I beg of you for all Love, that you would be pleaſed to order him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.</p>
                        <p>For ſome time I heard no more; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little intermiſſion, I thought I heard one make this reply: Though <hi>Elm</hi> with Three Heads, were none of your Allies; and though inſtead of you who are my Friend, the greateſt Stranger of all our kind, ſhould deſire the ſame thing of me, I would grant it; for my Profeſſion ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges me to aſſiſt every Body. You ſhall therefore acquaint <hi>Elm</hi> with Three Heads, That for the Cure of his Diſtemper, it is neceſſary, that he Suck in as much humide, and as little dry Nouriſhment, as poſſibly he can; that for that end he ought to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the little Fibres of his Root, towards the moiſteſt place of his Bed: That he muſt keep himſelf Merry and Chearful, and daily be diverted by a conſort of Muſick, of ſome excellent Nightingals. You'll hear from him afterwards, how he finds
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57769:141"/> himſelf, with that courſe of living; and then according to the Progreſs of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, when we have prepared his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, ſome Stork of his Friends ſhall from me give him a Gliſter, that will fully reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him.</p>
                        <p>Theſe words being ended, I heard not the leaſt noiſe more; till about a quarter of an hour after, that a voice which I fancy I had not obſerved before, came to my Ears, and ſpake in this manner, <hi>Hola, Gaffer Forked Trunk,</hi> what, do ye Sleep? I heard another voice that thus replied, No, <hi>Freſh-bark,</hi> why? Becauſe, ſaid the firſt that ſpake, I find the ſame Emotion in me, that commonly we do, when theſe Animals they call Men, come near us; and I would ask you, if you feel the ſame thing?</p>
                        <p>It was ſome time before the other made Anſwer; as if he intended to employ the moſt exquiſite of his Senſes in that Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; but at length he cried out: Good God, you are in the right, and I ſwear to you I find my Organs ſo full of the Ideas of a Man, that I am the moſt miſtaken in the world, if there be not one very near to this place: At that time there was a mixt noiſe of voices that ſaid, they ſmelt out a Man.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="134" facs="tcp:57769:142"/> It was in vain for me to look about on all hands; I could not diſcover whence that word could come: At length being a little recovered from the Horror, whereinto that accident had caſt me; I made anſwer to the voice, which I took to be that which had asked, if there was any Man there; that there was one: But I beſeech you, continued I, whoever you be that ſpeak to me, tell we who you are. Within a trice after I heard theſe words:</p>
                        <p>We ſtand in thy Preſence; thine Eyes behold us; and yet thou ſeeſt us not: Look upon theſe Oaks, on which we perceive thine Eyes are fixt: They are we that ſpeak to thee; and if thou be ſurprized that we ſpeak a Language, uſed in the World from whence thou comeſt; know, that our firſt Parents were Natives of it: They lived in
<hi>Epirus,</hi> in the Foreſt of <hi>Dodona;</hi> where their natural goodneſs inclined them to render Oracles to the afflicted, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted them. For that end they learnt the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, which at that time was moſt univerſal; that ſo they might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: And becauſe we are deſcended of them, from Father to Son, the gift of Prophecy hath been tranſmitted even to us. Now thou muſt know, That a great Eagle, to whom our Fathers of <hi>Dodona</hi> had given retreat; being diſabled from going
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57769:142"/> to prey, becauſe ſhe had broken one of her Leggs, fed upon the Acorns, which their branches furniſhed her with: When one day, being impatient of living in a World where ſhe ſuffered ſo much, ſhe took a flight to the Sun; and proſecuted her Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſo happily, that at length ſhe arrived in the luminous Globe, where we are: But upon her arrival, the heat of the Climate put her into a reaching to Vomit, which made her bring up a great quantity of Acorns, not as yet digeſted; theſe Acorns ſprouted, and produced the Oaks which were our Progenitors.</p>
                        <p>In this manner we changed our Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Nevertheleſs, though you hear us ſpeak a humane Language, you muſt not therefore conclude, That the other Trees expreſs themſelves ſo: No Trees, but we Oaks deſcended from the Foreſt of <hi>Dodona,</hi> ſpeak as you do. For as for the other Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, they expreſs themſelves after this manner. Have you not minded that ſoft and gentle Breeze, that never fails to blow about the Skirts of a Wood? That's the breath of their Words; and that eaſie Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, or delicate Whiſper, whereby they break the ſacred ſilence of their ſolitude, is, to ſpeak properly, their Language. But though the noiſe of Foreſts ſeem always to be the ſame; yet it is ſo different, that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57769:143"/> every kind of vegetables have diſtinctly their own; ſo that the Birch ſpeaks not like the Maple, nor the Beach like the Cherry Tree: Had the Fooliſh People of your World, heard me ſpeak as I do, they would have thought it had been a Devil, encloſed within my Bark; for they are ſo far from believing that we can reaſon, that they do not imagine we have a Senſitive Soul; though every day they ſee, that at the firſt blow the Woodman gives the Tree, the Hatchet enters the Wood four times deeper, than at the ſecond; and they ought to conjecture, that the firſt blow ſurpriſed it, and took it unprovided; ſince that as ſoon as it is warned by the pain, it contracts within it ſelf, unites it Forces for reſiſting, and in a manner petrified, that it may withſtand the ſharpneſs of its Enemies Arms. But it is not my deſign, to make blind Men Judges of Colours; an Individual is to me the whole kind, and the whole kind, is no more to me than an Individual, when the Individual is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Errors of the kind; and therefore be attentive, for in ſpeaking to you, it's the ſame thing to me, as if I ſpoke to all Mankind.</p>
                        <p>You are to underſtand then, in the firſt place, That almoſt all the warbling Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts of the Muſick of Birds, are compoſed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57769:143"/> in praiſe of Trees; but in recompence alſo of the pains they take, in celebrating our famous Actions, it is we that take care to hide their Amours; for don't you imagine when it coſts you ſo much trouble to find one of their Neſts, that that's occaſioned by the Sagacity wherewith they hide it? No, it is the Tree it ſelf, that hath twiſted its Boughs about the neſt, to ſecure the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of his Lodger, from the Cruelties of Man: And on the contrary, conſider the Airies of thoſe, which are hatched either for the deſtruction of Birds, their fellow Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, ſuch as Sparrow-Hawks, Hobbies, Kites, Faulcons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or which only ſpeak to breed Quarrels, as Jays and Magpies; or that delight to frighten us, as Owls and Howlets: You ſhall obſerve, that the Neſts of ſuch are expoſed to the ſight of all People; becauſe the Tree removes its Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from them, that it may leave them for a Prey.</p>
                        <p>But there is no need of ſpecifying ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, to prove that Trees exert your Functions, as well in Mind as in Body. Is there any one amongſt you, who hath not obſerved, that in the Spring, when the Sun hath refreſhed our Bark with a fertile Sap, we thruſt out our Branches, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them loaded with Fruit, upon the Breaſts of the Earth, that we are in Love
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57769:144"/> withal? The Earth on her ſide opens, and is warmed with the like heat; and makes her approaches towards a Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whilſt our Branches diſcharge into her Lap, that which ſhe ſo ardently deſires to conceive. She is, however, Nine Months in breeding and forming that
<hi>Embrio,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe bring it forth; but the Tree her Husband, fearing that the Winters cold may be prejudicial to her Conception, ſtrips himſelf of his green Garment to cover her, and contents himſelf with an old
<hi>Fuil-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mort</hi> Cloak, to hide part of his Nakedneſs.</p>
                        <p>Well then, O Men, you look eternally on theſe things, and never ſee them: Nay, more convincing Proofs have preſented themſelves to your Eyes; but none are ſo Blind, as thoſe that will not See.</p>
                        <p>I liſtened moſt attentively to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, with which that Arboreal Voice entertained me, and was expecting the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel; when all of a ſudden it broke off with a Tone like to the Whizzing of the ſhortneſs of Breath, that hinders one to ſpeak.</p>
                        <p>When I perceived it obſtinately reſolved to be ſilent, I adjured it by all, which I thought might moſt affect it, that it would vouchſafe to inſtruct one, who had run the Risk of ſo long and dangerous a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, upon the account only of learning.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57769:144"/> At the ſame time I heard Two or Three Voices, which for my ſake made the ſame requeſt to it, and one I diſtinguiſhed that ſaid to it, as if in anger,</p>
                        <p>Well then, ſince you complain ſo much of your Lungs, repoſe your ſelf; I'll tell him the Story of the Amorous Trees.</p>
                        <p>Whoever you be, cried I, falling upon my Knees, O Wiſeſt of all the Oaks of <hi>Dodona,</hi> who condeſcendeſt to take the pains to inſtruct me, know this; That you ſhall not teach an ungrateful Perſon; for I vow, that if ever I return to my native Globe, I ſhall publiſh the Wonders, you are pleaſed to make me a Witneſs of. I had no ſooner made this Proteſtation, but I heard the ſame voice proceed in this manner: Look, Little Man, and you ſhall ſee about Fourteen or Fifteen ſteps to the Right Hand, Two Twin-Trees of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Stature, which confounding their Branches and Roots, ſtrive by all poſſible means to unite and become but one.</p>
                        <p>I turned my Eyes towards theſe Plants of Love, and obſerved that the leaves of both gently ſtirred, as it were, by a voluntary Motion, excited by their Agitation ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a murmur, that hardly it grazed upon the Ear; and yet one would have ſaid, that thereby they mutually asked, and anſwered one another.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="140" facs="tcp:57769:145"/> Having ſpent as much time as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to obſerve that double Vegetable, my good Friend the Oak went on in his diſcourſe, after this manner:</p>
                        <p>You cannot have lived to this Age, and not have heard of the celebrated Friendſhip of <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Oreſtes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I would deſcribe to you all the Joys of a ſweet Paſſion, and tell you the Wonders wherewith theſe Lovers aſtoniſhed their Age, did I not fear that ſo much Light might offend the Eyes of your Reaſon; and therefore I ſhall paint thoſe two young Suns only in their Eclipſe.</p>
                        <p>Let this then ſuffice you to know, That one day the brave <hi>Oreſtes</hi> being engaged in a Battle, ſought out for his dear
<hi>Pyla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> that he might have the Pleaſure of overcoming or dying in his Preſence. When he perceived him amidſt an hundred Arms of Iron, lifted up over his Head: Alas! what became of him? In deſpair he threw himſelf through a Foreſt of Pikes: He cried, roared and foamed: But how ill do I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the fearful Commotions of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolable Man; he tore his hair, bit his Hands, rent his Wounds; nay, and when I have ſaid all I can ſay, I am obliged to confeſs, that the means of expreſſing his grief, died with himſelf. When he thought to cut out a way with his Sword to get to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57769:145"/> the aſſiſtance of <hi>Pylades,</hi> a Mountain of Men withſtood his paſſage. Nevertheleſs he broke through them; and having long marched upon the Bloody Trophies of his Victory, by little and little he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached to <hi>Pylades;</hi> but <hi>Pylades</hi> ſeemed to him already ſo near Death, that he durſt hardly reſiſt his Enemies any longer, for fear he might ſurvive the thing for which alone he lived. To ſee his Eyes already full of the ſhades of Death, one would have ſaid, That he endeavoured by his Looks to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Murderers of his Friend. At length
<hi>Pylades</hi> fell down dead; and amorous <hi>Oreſtes</hi> perceiving his own life, to be upon the brink of his Lips, ſtill retained it; till with a wandring look, having ſought and found out <hi>Pylades</hi> amongſt the Dead, he ſeemed, by joining Mouth to Mouth, as if he intended to infuſe his Soul into the Body of his Friend.</p>
                        <p>The Younger of thoſe two Heroes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired upon the dead Body of his Friend; and you muſt know, that from the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their Trunk, which without doubt, impregnated the Earth, two young Shrubs were ſeen to ſprout out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their dry bones; whoſe Stem and Branches mingling promiſcuouſly together, ſeemed to haſten to grow only, that they might be twiſted into a cloſer Contexture.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57769:146"/> It was viſible that they had changed their Being, without forgetting what they had been; for their perfumed Buds leaned one upon another, and interchanged the Warmth of their Breathing, as it were to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves blow the ſooner: But what ſhall I ſay of the loving Diſtribution, that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their Society? The Juyce, wherein the nouriſhment reſides, never offered it ſelf to their Stock, but they ceremoniouſly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it: The one was never ill fed, but the other decayed for want; they both Suckt inwardly the Breaſts of their Nurſe; as ye Men do outwardly the Teats of yours. At length theſe happy Lovers brought forth Apples, but ſuch miraculous Apples, as wrought greater Wonders than their Sires had done. All that eat of the Apples of the one, were inſtantly ſmitten with a Paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Love for every one, that had taſted the Fruit of the other; and this happened almoſt daily, becauſe all the Boughs of <hi>Pylades</hi> environed, or were environed by <hi>Oreſtes;</hi> and their Fruit, that were almoſt Twins, could not endure to be diſtant one from the other.</p>
                        <p>Nature however ſo cautiouſly diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their double Efficacy, that when one Man did eat the Fruit of one of theſe Trees, and another Man the Fruit of the other, it produced Reciprocal Friendſhip; and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57769:146"/> when the ſame happened to two Perſons of different Sexes, it begot Love; but ſuch a vigorous Love, as ſtill retained the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of its Cauſe; for though that Fruit proportioned its effect to the Capacity, ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening its force in a Woman, yet it ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſomewhat that was maſculine.</p>
                        <p>It is alſo to be remarked, That he of the two who had eaten moſt, was alſo moſt beloved. The Fruit was not only ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lovely, but very ſweet alſo; there being nothing ſo lovely and pleaſant as Friendſhip. And indeed, it was the two qualities of Lovely and Good, which ſeldom meet in one ſubject, that put it into Vogue. How often by its miraculous virtue, hath it mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply'd the Examples of <hi>Pylades</hi> and
<hi>Ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes:</hi> Since that time there have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſuch as
<hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Theſeus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi> and <hi>Patroclus, Niſus</hi> and <hi>Euryalus;</hi> in ſhort, of an infinite number of thoſe, who by more than humane friendſhips, have conſecrated their Memory in the Temple of Eternity. Cyens of theſe Trees were carried to
<hi>Peloponneſus;</hi> and the place of Exerciſe, where the
<hi>Thebans</hi> trained their Youth, was adorned with them: They were planted there in a ſtreight line; and in the ſeaſon, when the Fruit hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the branches, the youth who daily went into the place, being tempted by the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57769:147"/> thereof, refrained not from eating; which according to cuſtom preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced their Courage. They forthwith interchanged their Souls; every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the half of another, living leſs in himſelf than in his Friend; and the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedeſt became bold and raſh, for the ſake of him he loved.</p>
                        <p>That celeſtial Paſſion warmed their Blood with ſo noble an Heat, that by the advice of the wiſer, theſe Lovers were liſted for the Wars into one Company: They have been called ſince, becauſe of the Heroick Actions which they atchieved, <hi>The ſacred Band.</hi> Theſe Exploits went a great deal further, than the <hi>Thebans</hi> had promiſed themſelves; for in time of Fight, every one of theſe Bravos, ventured ſuch incredible Efforts, for the ſafety of his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or for meriting his Affection, that the like hath not been ſeen in Antiquity: And indeed, ſo long as that amorous Company ſubſiſted, the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who before were reckoned the worſt Souldiers of all the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> fought and ſtill overcame afterwards the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> themſelves, the moſt War-like people upon the face of the Earth.</p>
                        <p>But amongſt a vaſt number of laudable Actions cauſed by theſe Apples; they alſo produced (though innocently) ſome very ignominious ones.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="145" facs="tcp:57769:147"/>
                           <hi>Myrrha,</hi> a young Lady of Quality, eat of them with
<hi>Cinyras</hi> her Father; unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately the one was of <hi>Pylades,</hi> and the other of <hi>Oreſtes.</hi> Love immediately there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſwallowed up, and ſo confounded Nature, that <hi>Cinyras</hi> could ſwear, I am my own Son-in-Law; and <hi>Myrrha,</hi> I am my own Step-Mother. In ſhort, I think it ſufficient to inform you of the nature of that Crime, that at Nine Months end the Father became the Grandfather of thoſe he begot; and the Daughter was brought to bed of her Brothers.</p>
                        <p>Nor was Chance yet ſatisfied with this Crime; it ſo ordered matters, that a Bull coming into the Gardens of King <hi>Minos,</hi> vnluckily found under a Tree of <hi>Oreſtes</hi> ſome Apples, which he ſwallowed down; I ſay unluckily, becauſe the Queen <hi>Paſiphae</hi> daily eat of that Fruit: And ſo you have them mad in Love one with another. I ſhall not, however, ſpeak of the enormous Enjoyment; it ſhall ſuffice to ſay, That <hi>Paſiphae</hi> plunged her ſelf into a Crime, that was never matched before.</p>
                        <p>Exactly about that time, the famous Carver
<hi>Pigmalion,</hi> was cutting a Marble Statue of <hi>Venus</hi> in the palace. The Queen, who loved good Workmen, made him a Preſent of a couple of theſe Apples: He eat the faireſt; and becauſe accidentally he
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57769:148"/> wanted Water, which, as you know, is neceſſary for the cutting of Marble; he moiſtened his Statue with the Juyce of the other. The Marble, influenced by this Juyce, by little and little grew ſoft; and the efficacious virtue of that Apple, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the deſign of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, delineated within the Image, the draughts that it had met with in the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; for it dilated, heated, and coloured, proportionably to the nature of the Places that it found in its paſſages. In fine, the Marble becoming animate, and being touched with the Paſſion of the Apple, embraced
<hi>Pigmalion,</hi> with all her heart; and <hi>Pigmalion,</hi> tranſported with a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Love, took her for Wife.</p>
                        <p>In the ſame Province the young <hi>Iphis</hi> had eaten of that Fruit, with the fair <hi>Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,</hi> her Companion in all the Exerciſes that are requiſite to cauſe a reciprocal Friendſhip: Their Banquet was attended by its uſual effect: But becauſe <hi>Iphis</hi> had found it to be very agreeable to her Palate, ſhe fed ſo heartily, that her Friendſhip encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with the number of Apples, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe could not be ſatisfied, uſurped all the functions of Love; and that Love growing ſtill and ſtill ſtronger, became more maſculine and vigorous: For ſeeing her whole Body impregnated with that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57769:148"/> Fruit, ſtrove to form Motions that might anſwer the Caprices of her Will; it ſtirred up ſo powerfully its own matter, that it made to it ſelf much ſtronger Organs, fit to comply with her Deſire, and to ſatisfie her Love in its moſt manly Extent: My meaning is, That
<hi>Iphis</hi> became what one ought to be, that marries a Wife.</p>
                        <p>I ſhould term this ſtrange accident a Miracle, had I ſtill a name to give to the following Prodigy.</p>
                        <p>A moſt accompliſhed Youth, called
<hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus,</hi> had by his Love merited the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a very lovely Maid, whom the Poets have celebrated by the Name of <hi>Echo.</hi> But ſeeing Women, as you know, are fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of being much made of, than thoſe of our Sex; ſhe having heard the virtue of the Apples of <hi>Oreſtes</hi> much talked of, uſed means to procure a great many of them, from ſeveral parts; and becauſe ſhe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, (Love being always fearful) That thoſe of the one Tree, might have leſs force than the other, ſhe would have him to taſte of both: But ſo ſoon as he had eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them, the image of
<hi>Echo</hi> was quite blotted out of his memory; all his Love turned towards him who had digeſted the Fruit; and he became both the Lover and the Beloved; for the ſubſtance drawn from the Apple of <hi>Pylades,</hi> embraced within
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57769:149"/> him the ſubſtance of the Apple of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtes.</hi> That twin-fruit diffuſed through the whole maſs of his blood, excited all the parts of his body to careſs one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: His Heart, where their double virtue boiled, darted its flames inwards; all his Members animated with his Paſſion, endeavouring to penetrate one into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Nay, not ſo much as his Image ſtill burning in the cold Fountains, but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted his Body to join it: In a word, poor <hi>Narciſſus</hi> fell deſperately in Love with himſelf.</p>
                        <p>I will not be tedious in relating to you his deplorable Cataſtrophy; the Ages of Antiquity have ſpoken enough of that: And beſides I have Two Adventures ſtill to acquaint you with, which will take up the time far better.</p>
                        <p>You ſhall know then, that the fair <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macis</hi> frequented the company of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd <hi>Hermaphroditus,</hi> but with no other Privacies, than what the Neighbourhood of their Houſes could allow of: When For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who delights to diſturb the moſt quiet and harmleſs Lives, ſo ordered, that in an Aſſembly of Plays, where the rewards for Beauty and Running were two of theſe Apples, <hi>Hermaphroditus</hi> gained that of the Race, and <hi>Salmacis</hi> the other of Beauty. Though they had been gathered together,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57769:149"/> yet it was from different Branches; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe amorous Fruits mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo cunningly, that one of <hi>Pylades</hi> was never without another of <hi>Oreſtes;</hi> and that was the reaſon, why appearing to be Twins, they plucked always a Couple at a time. The fair
<hi>Salmacis</hi> eat her Apple, and pretty <hi>Hermaphroditus</hi> lockt his up in a Cupboard. <hi>Salmacis</hi> being inſpired with the effects of her own Apple, and of that of the Shepherd, which began to grow hot in his Cupboard, felt her ſelf attracted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, by the Sympathetick Flux and Reflux of the two.</p>
                        <p>The Shepherds Parents, who perceived the Amours of the Nymph, finding their advantage in that Alliance, endeavoured to entertain and promote it: And therefore having heard much talking of the Twin-Apples, as of a Fruit whoſe Juyce inclined People to Love, they diſtilled ſome of them; and having rectified the Spirit to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree, found a means to make their Son and his Lover drink of it. The virtue of the Juyce, being ſublimed to the higheſt degree it could be raiſed to, kindled in the Hearts of the Lovers, ſo vehement a deſire of Conjunction, that at firſt ſight
<hi>Herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus</hi> was ſwallowed up in <hi>Salmacis,</hi> and
<hi>Salmacis</hi> melted away in the Arms of <hi>Hermaphroditus:</hi> The one paſt into the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57769:150"/> other, and of two of different Sexes, they made up I know not what double Perſon, that was neither Man nor Woman. When
<hi>Hermaphroditus</hi> had a mind to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy <hi>Salmacis,</hi> he found himſelf to be the Nymph; and when <hi>Salmacis</hi> deſired to be embraced by <hi>Hermaphroditus,</hi> ſhe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her ſelf to be the Shepherd. This couple though ſtill retained its Unity; it Begat and Conceived, and yet was neither Man nor Woman: In ſhort, in it Nature hath ſhewn a Miracle, which ſhe hath never been able ſince to hinder from being One.</p>
                        <p>Well now, are not theſe pretty ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stories? Really they are; for to ſee a Daughter couple with her Father; a young Princeſs glut her ſelf with the Amours of a Bull; a Man aſpire to the Emjoyment of a Stone. Another to eſpouſe himſelf; a Maid to Celebrate a Marriage, which ſhe conſummated as a youth; to ceaſe to be a Man, without beginning to be a Woman; to become a Twin out of the Mothers Womb, and the Twin of another who had no Relation to him.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are things quite out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Road of Nature; and nevertheleſs, you'll be more ſurpriſed at what I am about to tell you.</p>
                        <p>Amongſt the ſumptuous Variety of all ſorts of Fruits and Trees, which were brought
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57769:150"/> from diſtant Climates, for the Marriage-Feaſt of
<hi>Cambyſes,</hi> there was preſented to him a Cien of <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> which he cauſed to be grafted upon a Plane Tree; and amongſt the Dainties of the laſt courſe, ſome Apples of the ſame Tree were ſerved up to him.</p>
                        <p>The delicacy of the Diſh invited him to eat heartily of it; and the ſubſtance of that Fruit, being after the three Concoctions converted into a perfect Seed; it formed in the Womb of the Queen, the Embryo of his Son <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> for all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of his Life, have made Phyſicians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that he muſt needs have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced after this manner.</p>
                        <p>When the young Heart of that Prince, was old enough to deſerve the anger of Love, it was not obſerved, that he ſighed at all after any of his own kind: he loved no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Trees, Groves and Woods; but above all thoſe that affected him, the lovely Plane Tree, whereon his Father
<hi>Cambyſes</hi> had formerly cauſed that ſhoot of <hi>Orestes</hi> to be graffed, wun his greateſt affection.</p>
                        <p>His Conſtitution ſuited ſo nicely with the progreſs of the Plane Tree, that he ſeemed to grow with the Branches of it: He daily went and embraced it; in his Sleep he dreamt of nothing elſe; and under the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy of its Green Hangings, he diſpatched all his Affairs. It was eaſily perceived,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57769:151"/> that the Plane Tree ſmitten with a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Flame, was raviſhed with his Careſſes: For on all occaſions, without any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reaſon, its Leaves were ſeen to ſhake, and in a manner leap for Joy; the Branches bend round about his Head, as it were to make a Crown for him, and to reach down ſo near to his Face, that it was eaſie to be known, that it was rather to kiſs him, than out of any natural inclination, of bending downwards. Nay, it was alſo obſerved, that out of Jealouſie it ranked its Leaves in order, joining one cloſe to the other, for fear leaſt the Sun-Beams pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through, might kiſs him as well as it. The King on his part, ſet no more bounds to his Love; he had his Bed made under the Plane Tree, and the Tree not not knowing how to repay his Friendſhip, beſtowed upon him the moſt precious thing that Trees have, which was its Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew, that every Morning dropt upon his Face.</p>
                        <p>Their Careſſes would have laſted longer, had not Death, the Enemy of Noble Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, put an end to them: <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> died of Love in the embraces of his dear Plane Tree; and the Perſians extreamly afflicted at the death of ſo good a Prince, reſolved that they might give him ſatisfaction even after his Death, that his Body ſhould be
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57769:151"/> burnt with the Branches of that Tree, and no other Wood employed in Conſuming it.</p>
                        <p>When the Funeral Pile was kindled, the Flame was ſeen to twiſt it ſelf with that of the Fat of the Body; and their burning Locks which curled one into the other, to taper into a Pyramide as far as could be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                        <p>That pure and ſubtile Fire divided not; but when it arrived at the Sun, whither you know all igneous matter tends, it formed the ſprout of the Apple-Tree of <hi>Ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes,</hi> which you ſee there on your Right Hand.</p>
                        <p>Now the Breed of that Fruit is loſt in your World, and I'll tell you how that miſchance happened.</p>
                        <p>Fathers and Mothers, who as you know, are only guided by intereſt, in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Domeſtick Affairs, being vext that their Children, ſo ſoon as they had eaten of theſe Apples, ſquandered away up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Friends all that they had, burnt all the young Plants they could find of that Tree; ſo that the kind being loſt, is the reaſon why no true Friend is now to be found.</p>
                        <p>As faſt then as theſe Trees were conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Fire, the Rain that fell, calcined their Aſhes, ſo that the congealed Juyce
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57769:152"/> was petrified in the ſame manner, as the ſap of burnt Fern is changed into Glaſs. Hence it is, that in all Climates of the Earth two Metallick Stones are formed of the aſhes of thoſe Twin-Trees, that now adays are called the Iron and Load-ſtone, which becauſe of the Sympathy of the Fruits of <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> the virtue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have ſtill retained, always aſpire to embrace one another; and obſerve that if the piece of the Load-ſtone be the bigger, it attracts the Iron; or if the piece of Iron exceed in quantity, it attracts the Load-ſtone; as formerly it happened in the miraculous Effects of the Apples of
<hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> of the one of which whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had eaten moſt, was the moſt beloved of him who had eaten the other.</p>
                        <p>Now Iron feeds ſo viſibly upon the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and the Load-ſtone upon the Iron, that the one ruſts, and the other loſes its force; unleſs they be put together for the reparation of what ſubſtance they loſe.</p>
                        <p>Have you never obſerved a piece of Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, laid upon the File-duſt of Iron, you'll ſee the Load-ſtone cover it ſelf in a trice with theſe metallick Atoms; and the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Heat wherewith they cling together, is ſo ſudden and impatient, that when they have embraced one another in all places, you would ſay that there is not one grain
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57769:152"/> of the Load-ſtone, that would not kiſs a grain of the Iron, nor a grain of the Iron, that would not be united to a grain of the Load-ſtone; for the Iron or Load-ſtone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparated, continually ſend out from their Maſs, ſome moſt agile little Bodies, in queſt of that which they love: But when they have found that, having got their deſire, every one puts an end to their Progreſs; and the Load-ſtone takes its reſt in poſſeſſing the Iron, as the Iron wholly contents its ſelf in the enjoyment of the Load-ſtone. From the Sap then of theſe two Trees, the humour which hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Being to thoſe two Metals has been derived.</p>
                        <p>Before that they were unknown; and if you have a mind to know, of what matter Arms were made for the War; <hi>Sampſon</hi> armed himſelf againſt the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> with the Jaw-bone of an Aſs;
<hi>Jupiter</hi> King of <hi>Crete,</hi> with Artificial Fire-works, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he imitated the Thunder, in ſubduing of his Enemies; and, in a word,
<hi>Hercules</hi> with a Club overcame Tyrants, and cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Monſters. But theſe two Metals, have another more ſpecifick relation to our two Trees: You muſt know, that though that Couple of Life-leſs Lovers incline towards the Pole, yet they never tend thither but in Company; and I'll tell you the Reaſon of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57769:153"/> it, after I have diſcourſed to you a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Poles.</p>
                        <p>The Poles are the Mouths of Heaven, by which it ſucks up again the Light, Heat, and Influences that it hath ſhed upon the Earth: Otherwiſe if all the Treaſures of the Sun, remounted not to their ſource, (all its Brightneſs being only a duſt of inflamed Atoms, which are detached from its Globe;) it would have been long ago ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, and ſhone no more: Or that abundance of little igneous Bodies, heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together upon the Earth, when they could not get out again, would have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conſumed it. There muſt then, as I have told you, be breathing Holes in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by which the Repletions of the Earth are diſcharged, and others by which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven may repair its loſſes; to the end the eternal Circulation of theſe little bodies of Life, may ſucceſſively paſs through all the Globes of this vaſt Univerſe. Now the breathing holes of Heaven are the Poles, through which it retakes the Souls of all that die in the other Worlds without it; and all the Stars are its Mouths, and the Pores through which again it exhales its Spirits. But to ſhew you, that this is not ſo new an Imagination; when your Ancient Poets, to whom Phyloſophy diſcovered the moſt hidden ſecrets of Nature, ſpake of an Hero,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57769:153"/> whoſe Soul they would have ſaid was gone to live with the Gods; they expreſſed it in this manner: He is gone up to the Pole, he is ſeated on the Pole, he hath paſt through the Pole; becauſe they knew that the Poles where the only Avenues, through which Heaven receives again, all that is gone out from thence. If the Authority of theſe great Men be not ſufficient to convince you, the Experience of your modern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigators, who have ſailed towards the North, may, perhaps, give you ſatisfaction. They have found, that the nearer they drew towards the Bear, during the Six Months of Night, when it was thought that Climate lay under a black Darkneſs, a great Light cleared the Horizon, which could not proceed but from the Pole; becauſe the more one drew near to it, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence removed from the Sun, that Light became greater. It is very probable then, that it proceeds from the Beams of day, and a great heap of Souls, which as you know, are only made of Luminous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, that are returning to Heaven by their wonted Doors.</p>
                        <p>This being ſo, it is no difficult matter to comprehend, wherefore the Iron rubbed with the Load-ſtone, or the Load-ſtone rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with the Iron, turns towards the Pole; for they being an Extract of the Body of
<hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lades</hi>
                           <pb n="158" facs="tcp:57769:154"/> and <hi>Orestes,</hi> and having ſtill retained the Inclinations of the two Trees, as the two Trees have thoſe of the Two Lovers, they ought to aſpire to be rejoined to their Soul; and therefore they skip towards the Pole, through which they perceive that it hath mounted; but with this Reſerve ſtill, that the Iron never turns that way, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be touched by the Load-ſtone, nor the Load-ſtone, unleſs it be rubbed with the Iron; by reaſon that the Iron will not quit a World, leaving his Friend the Load-ſtone behind, nor the Load-ſtone leaving its Friend the Iron, and that the one cannot reſolve to perform this Voyage without the other.</p>
                        <p>This voice, as I think, was about to go on with another Diſcourſe; but the noiſe of a great Alarm that happened hindred it: All the Foreſt in an uproar, reſounded with nothing but theſe Words, <hi>The Plague, the Plague, stand upon your Guard, look about ye.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I adjured the Tree, that had ſo long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained me in diſcourſe, to tell me the Cauſe of ſo great a Diſorder. Friend, ſaid he to me, we are not in theſe quarters, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently as yet informed of all the Particulars of the Evil: I'll only tell you in Three Words, that the Plague wherewith we are threatned, is that which Men call a Fire;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57769:154"/> we may very well call it ſo, becauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us there is no ſuch contagious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper. The remedy we are about to uſe againſt it, is to force our breath, and blow altogether, towards the place from whence the Inflamation comes, to the end we may drive back that bad Air. I believe that burning Feaver is occaſioned us by a fiery Beaſt, that for ſome days has been roaming about our Woods; for ſeeing they never go without Fire, and cannot be without it, this, without doubt, is come to ſet ſome of our Trees on Fire.</p>
                        <p>We ſent for the Animal <hi>Frozen-noſe,</hi> to come to our Aſſiſtance; however is not as yet arrived. But, farewel, I have no time to talk, we muſt look to the publick Safety; nay, do you look to your ſelf alſo, and fly for it, elſe you'll be in danger of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in our deſtruction.</p>
                        <p>I followed the counſel, but without much ſtraining, becauſe I knew my Legs. In the mean time I was ſo ill acquainted with the Geopraphy of the Country, that at the end of Eighteen hours, I found my ſelf at the back of the Foreſt that I thought I fled from; and to add to my fear, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred dreadful Thunder-claps ſtunned my Brains, whilſt the ghaſtly and pale Glimpſes of a Thouſand flaſhes of Lightning put out my Eye-ſight.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="160" facs="tcp:57769:155"/> Theſe Claps redoubled from time to time with ſo much fury, that one would have ſaid, The Foundations of the World were about to be over-turned; and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the Heavens never appeared more ſerene. Though I was at my wits end, yet the deſire of knowing the Cauſe of ſuch an extraordinary Accident, made me go towards the place, from whence the noiſe ſeemed to proceed.</p>
                        <p>I had advanced about four hundred Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, when I perceived in the middle of a great Plain, as it were, two Bowls, which having ruſtled and turned along time round one another, approached and then recoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: And I obſerved that when they knocked one againſt the other, then were theſe great Claps heard; but going a little farther on, I found that what at a diſtance I had taken for two Bowls, were two Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; one of which, tho round below, formed a Triangle about the middle, and his lofty Head with ruddy Locks, which floated upwards, ſpired into a Pyramide; his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was bored like a Sieve, and through theſe little holes, that ſerved him for Pores, thin flames glided, which ſeemed to cover him with a Plume of Fires.</p>
                        <p>Walking about there, I met with a very venerable old Man, who obſerved that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conflict, with no leſs curioſity than
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57769:155"/> my ſelf. He made me a ſign to draw nigh, I obeyed, and we ſat down by one another.</p>
                        <p>I had a deſign to have asked him the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that had brought him into that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but he ſtopt my Mouth with theſe words; Well then, you ſhall know the motive, that brought me into this Country. And thereupon he gave me a full account of all the particulars of his Voyage. I leave it to you to judge, in what amazement I was. In the mean while, to increaſe my conſternation, as I was boyling with deſire to ask him, what Spirit revealed my thoughts to him: No, no, cryed he, it's no Spirit that reveals your thoughts to me—</p>
                        <p>This new hit of Divination, made me obſerve him with greater attention than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and I perceived that he acted my Carriage, my Geſtures and Looks, that he poſtured all his Members, and ſhaped all the parts of his Countenance, according to the pattern of mine; in a word, my Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in relief could not have repreſented me better. I ſee, ſaid he, you are in pain to know why I counterfeit you, and I am willing to tell you. Know then, that to the end I might know your inſide, I diſpofed all the parts of my Body, into the ſame Order I ſaw yours in; for being in all parts ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated like you, by that diſpoſition of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I excite in my ſelf the ſame thought, that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57769:156"/> the ſame diſpoſition of matter raiſes in you.</p>
                        <p>You will judge this to be a thing poſſible, if heretofore you have obſerved, that Twins who are like, have commonly the like Mind, Paſſions and Will: inſomuch, that there were two Twins at
<hi>Paris,</hi> who always had the ſame Sickneſſes, and the ſame Health; married without knowing one anothers deſign, the ſame day and at the ſame hour; wrote Letters mutually to one another in the ſame Senſe, Words and Stile; and in ſhort, have upon the ſame Subject compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Copy of the ſame kind of Verſe, with the ſame Stops, Words and Order. Now don't you ſee, that it was impoſſible, but that the Compoſition of the Organs of their Bodies, being in all Circumſtances alike, they muſt act in a like manner; ſeeing two like Inſtruments alike touched, ought to render a like Harmony? And that ſo I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conformed my Body wholly to yours, and become, if I may ſay ſo, your Twin; it is impoſſible, but that the ſame Agitation of Matter, muſt cauſe in both of us the ſame Agitation of Mind.</p>
                        <p>Having ſaid ſo, he fell a counterfeiting me again, and thus went on:</p>
                        <p>You are at preſent in great pain to know, the Original of the Conflict of theſe two Monſters; but I will inform you of it. Know then, that the Trees of the Foreſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57769:156"/> us, being unable with their blowing, to repel the attempts of the fiery Beaſt, have had their recourſe to the Animal
<hi>Frozen-Noſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I never heard of theſe Animals, ſaid I to him, but from an Oak of this Country, and that in great haſte too, becauſe it was ſollicitous for its own ſafety; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would beg of you, to give me ſome account of them.</p>
                        <p>He thereupon ſpake to me in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: In this Globe where we are, we ſhould ſee the Woods very thin ſow'n, by reaſon of the great number of the fiery Beaſts that deſtroy them; were it not for the Animals <hi>Frozen-Noſes,</hi> which at the deſire of the Foreſts their Friends, come daily to cure the Sick Trees: I ſay cure, for no ſooner have they, from their Icy Mouth, blown upon the coals of that Plague, but they put it out.</p>
                        <p>In the World of the Earth, from whence both you and I are come, the fiery Beaſt is called the <hi>Salamander;</hi> and the Animal
<hi>Frozen-Noſe,</hi> is known by the name of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora.</hi> Now you muſt know, that the <hi>Remoras</hi> live towards the extremity of the Pole, at the bottom of the <hi>Mare Glaciale;</hi> and it is the cold of theſe Fiſhes, evaporated through their Scales, which makes the Sea-Water in thoſe quarters to freeze, though it be Salt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="164" facs="tcp:57769:157"/> Moſt Navigators, who have Sailed for the diſcovery of
<hi>Green-land,</hi> have at length experienced, that in certain Seaſons they found none of the Ice, which at other times had ſtopt them: Now though that Sea was open at the time, when it is bittereſt Winter there, yet they have attributed the cauſe of it, to ſome ſecret Heat that had thawed it; but it is far more probable, that the <hi>Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> who only feed upon Ice, had at that time devoured the whole ſtock. Beſides you are to know, that ſome Months after they have filled their Bellies, that ſtrange Food of uneaſy digeſtion, ſo chills their Stomack, that their very blowing of their Breath, freezes again all the Sea under the Pole. When they come on Land (for they live in both Elements) they fill their Paunch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Hemlock, Wolf-bane, Opium and Mandrakes.</p>
                        <p>It's wondred at in our World, whence proceed thoſe piercing North-Winds, that always bring Froſt with them; but if our Country-men knew what we know, that the <hi>Remoras</hi> live in that Climate, they would know as well as we, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a puff of their Breath, whereby they endeavour to blow back the heat of the Sun that draws near them.</p>
                        <p>That Stygian-Water wherewith the Great <hi>Alexander</hi> was poyſoned, and whoſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57769:157"/> Coldneſs petrified his Bowels, was the Piſs of one of theſe Animals. In fine, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora</hi> contains all the principles of Cold in ſo eminenta degree, that paſſing under a Ship the Veſſel is ſeized with Cold, and ſtruck with ſuch a Numneſs, that it cannot wag out of the place. And that's the reaſon that one half of thoſe, who have cruiſed North-ward, for the diſcovery of the Pole, never came back again; becauſe it is a Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle if the <hi>Remoras,</hi> who are ſo numerous in that Sea, ſtop not their Veſſels. And ſo much for the Animals
<hi>Frozen-Noſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But as to the Fiery Beaſts, they lodge on Land under Mountains of burning <hi>Bitumen,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Aetna, Veſuvius</hi> and others. The Pimples which you ſee upon the Breaſt of this Beaſt, that proceed from the Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Liver, are—</p>
                        <p>Hear we put a ſtop to our Talk, that we might be more attentive to that famous Duel.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Salamander</hi> attacked with much ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; but the <hi>Remora</hi> defended impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Every daſh they gave one another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got a clap of Thunder; as it happens in the Worlds there abouts, where the Claſhing of a hot Cloud with a cold, cauſes the ſame Report.</p>
                        <p>At every glance of Rage which the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamander</hi> darted againſt its Enemy, out of its Eyes flaſhed a reddiſh Light, that ſeemed
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57769:158"/> to kindle the Air in flying; it ſweat boyling Oyl, and piſſed <hi>Aqua-fortis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Remora</hi> on the other hand, that groſs, ſquare and heavy Animal, preſented a Body ſcaled all over with Yſicles. Its large Eyes lookt like two Chryſtal-plates, whoſe glances conveyed ſo chilling a light, that on what member of my Body it fixed them, I felt a ſhivering Winter-cold. If I thought to put my Hand before me, my Fingers ends were nummed; nay, the very Air about infected with its quality, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed into Snow, the Earth hardned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Steps; and I could reckon the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Beaſt, by the number of the Chil-blanes, that welcomed me when I trode upon them.</p>
                        <p>In the beginning of the Fight, the <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi> by the vigorous activity of its firſt heat, had put the <hi>Remora</hi> into a Sweat; but at length that Sweat cooling again, glazed all the Plain with ſo ſlippery an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namel, that the <hi>Salamander</hi> could not get up to the
<hi>Remora</hi> without falling. The Philoſopher and I knew very well, that the trouble of falling and riſing ſo many times, had made it weary; for theſe Thunder-claps ſo dreadful before, that proceeded from the ſhock he gave its Enemy, were no more now but the dull Sound of thoſe little After-claps, which denote the end of a
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57769:158"/> Storm; and that dull Sound, deadned by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, degenerated into a Whizzing, like to that of a hot Iron plunged into cold Water.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi>Remora</hi> perceived, that the Fight was near an end, by the Weakneſs of the ſhock which was hardly felt by it, it raiſed it ſelf upon an Angle of its Cube, and with all its weight fell upon the Breaſt of the <hi>Salamander,</hi> with ſo good ſucceſs, that the Heart of the <hi>Salamander,</hi> wherein all the reſt of its heat was contracted, burſting, made ſo fearful a Crack, that I know nothing in nature to compare it to.</p>
                        <p>Thus died the Fiery Beaſt, under the lazy reſiſtance of the Animal <hi>Frozen-Noſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sometime after the <hi>Remora</hi> was gone, we approached the place of Battel; and the old Man having daubed his Hands over with the Earth, on which it had walked, as a Preſervative againſt burning, laid hold on the Dead Body of the <hi>Salamander.</hi> Give me but the Body of this Animal, ſaid he, and I've no need for Fire in my Kitchen; for provided it be hung upon the Pot-hook, it will Boyl and Roaſt all that's laid upon the Hearth. As for the Eyes, I'll carefully keep them; if they were cleanſed from the Shades of Death, you'd take them for two little Suns. The Antients of our World knew well what uſe to make of them; they called them burning-Lamps, and never hung them
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57769:159"/> up but in the Pompous Monuments of Illuſtrious Perſons.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Moderns</hi> have found ſome of them, by digging into theſe famous Tombs; but their ignorant Curioſity made them put them out, thinking to find behind the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Membranes, the Fire which they ſaw ſhine there.</p>
                        <p>The old Man went on ſtill, and I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, liſtning very attentively to the Wonders he told me. But ſince I have been ſpeaking of the Fight, I muſt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Diſcourſe which we had, concerning the Animal <hi>Frozen-Noſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I don't think, ſaid he to me, that you have ever ſeen a <hi>Remora;</hi> for they are Fiſh that never riſe to the brim of the Water; nay, ſeldom or never do they leave the Northern Sea: But without doubt you have ſeen a ſort of Animals, which in ſome manner may be reckoned of their kind. I told you juſt now, that that Sea which reaches towards the Pole, is full of <hi>Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> that ſpawn in the mud as other Fiſhes do. You muſt know then, that that Seed, the Extract of all their maſs, ſo eminently contains all its Coldneſs, that if a Ship paſs over it, the Ship contracts one or more Worms, which become Birds; whoſe Blood is ſo deſtitute of heat, that though they have Wings, yet they are reckoned amongſt
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57769:159"/> Fiſhes: And ſo the Pope, who knows their Original, forbids them not to be eaten in Lent; and theſe are the Fowls which in
<hi>France</hi> they call <hi>Maquereuſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I marched on ſtill without any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign than to follow him, but ſo glad that I had found a Man, that I durſt not take my Eyes off of him; ſo afraid was I to loſe my Man. Mortal Youth, ſaid he to me, (for I well perceive, that you have not as yet paid the tribute, which we owe to Nature, as I have done,) ſo ſoon as I ſaw you, I diſcovered in your Face, ſomewhat that ſhews you to be curious and inquiſitive. If I be not miſtaken in the Shape and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of your Body, you muſt be a
<hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and a Native of <hi>Paris.</hi> That City is the place, wherewith I ended my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, which I had carried about with me all over
<hi>Europe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>My name is <hi>Campanella,</hi> and I am a
<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labrian</hi> by Nation. Since my coming into the Sun, I have ſpent my time in viſiting the Climates of this great Globe, that I may diſcover the Wonders of them: It is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the Earth is, into Kingdoms, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks, States and Principalities; ſo that Four-footed Beaſts, Fowl, Plants and Stones, every one have their own; and though ſome of theſe allow no entrance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, to Animals of a ſtrange kind,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57769:160"/> eſpecially to Men, whom the Birds above all others mortally hate, yet I can travel over all without any danger; becauſe the Soul of a Philoſopher, is made up of more ſubtile Parts, than the Inſtruments which might be made uſe of to torment it. I was by good luck in the Province of the Trees, when the diſorders of the <hi>Salamander</hi> began thoſe great Thunder-claps, that you muſt have heard as well as I, which guided me to their Field of Battel, whither you came ſoon after; but I was upon my return to the Province of Philoſophers— What, ſaid I to him, are there Philoſophers alſo then in the Sun? Are there, replied the good Man, yes, ſure; and they are the chief Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Sun, and the very ſame, whom Fame in your World doth celebrate with ſo full Mouth. You may ſhortly converſe with them, provided you have the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to follow me; for before Three Days be over, I hope to be in their City. I don't think you can poſſibly perceive the manner, how theſe great Spirits are tranſported hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. No certainly, cried I, for could ſo many others been hitherto ſo blind, as not to find the way? Or that after our Death, we fall into the Hands of an Examiner of Spirits, who according to our Capacity grants or refuſes us our freedom in the Sun?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="171" facs="tcp:57769:160"/> Nothing of that, replied the old Man: It's by a Principle of Similitude, that Souls attain to this maſs of Light; for this World is made up of nothing elſe, but the Spirits of every thing that dies in the Circumambient Orbs, ſuch as <hi>Mercury, Venus,</hi> the Earth, <hi>Mars, Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturn.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus, ſo ſoon as a Plant, a Beaſt or a Man expire, their Souls without extincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mount to its Sphere, juſt as you ſee the flame of a Candle points up thither, in ſpight of the Tallow that holds it by the Feet. Now all theſe Souls being united to the ſource of Day, and purged from the groſs matter that peſtered them, exert far more noble Functions than thoſe of Growing, Feeling and Reaſoning; for they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in making the Blood, and vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Sun, that great and perfect Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal: And therefore alſo, you ought not to doubt, but that the Sun acts by the Spirit, more perfectly far than you do; ſince it is by the heat of a Million of theſe Souls rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, whereof his own is an Elixir, that he knows the ſecret of Life, that he influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences the matter of your Worlds, with the power of Generation, and that he makes Bodies ſenſible that they have a Being; and, in ſhort, that he renders himſelf, and all things elſe, viſible.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="172" facs="tcp:57769:161"/> Now it remains, that I ſhould clear to you, why the Souls of Philoſopers, do not eſſentially join to the maſs of the Sun, as thoſe of other Men.</p>
                        <p>There are three orders of Spirits in all the Planets, that is to ſay, in the little Worlds which move about this.</p>
                        <p>The groſſer ſerve only to repair the Plumpneſs of the Sun, the ſubtile inſinuate into the place of his Beams; but thoſe of Philoſophers, having contracted no Impurity in their exile, arrive entire in the Sphere of Day to become its Inhabitants. Now they are not as others, a conſtituent part of its Maſs; becauſe the matter that compoſes them, in the point of their Generation, is ſo exactly mixed, that nothing can again diſſolve it: Like to that which forms Gold, Diamonds, and the Stars, whereof all the parts are ſo cloſely interwoven and knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that the ſtrongeſt Diſſolvent cannot ſeparate the Mixture.</p>
                        <p>Now theſe Souls of Philſophers, are ſo much in regard of other Souls, what Gold, Diamonds, and the Stars are, in reſpect of other Bodies; that <hi>Epicurus</hi> in the Sun, is the ſame
<hi>Epicurus,</hi> who heretofore lived in the Earth.</p>
                        <p>The pleaſure which I received in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that great Man, ſhortned my way; and I often ſtarted curious Queſtions, about
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57769:161"/> which I importuned his opinion, that I might be thereby inſtructed: And really I never found ſo great goodneſs in any Man, as in him; for though by reaſon of the Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Subſtance, he might in a few Days have arrived in the Kingdom of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers; yet he choſe rather to take the trouble of Jogging on with me, than to leave me amidſt vaſt Solitudes.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs he was in great haſte; for I remember that having asked him, why he returned before he had ſurveyed all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of that great world? He made anſwer, that his Impatience to ſee one of his Friends, who was newly arrived, obliged him to break off his Travels. I found by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of his diſcourſe, that his Friend was that famous Philoſopher of our time <hi>Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur des Cartes,</hi> and that he made all haſte to meet him.</p>
                        <p>He made anſwer alſo, when I asked him, what he thought of his natural Philoſophy? that it ought to be read with the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as Men liſten to Oracles. Not, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he, but that the Science of natural things hath need, as other Sciences have, to prepoſſeſs our Judgment with <hi>Axioms,</hi> which it proves not: But the Principles of his are ſimple and ſo natural, that being once ſuppoſed, there is nothing that more neceſſarily ſatisfies all Appearances.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="174" facs="tcp:57769:162"/> I could not forbear to interrupt him in this place: But methinks, ſaid I to him, that that Philoſopher hath always impugn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the
<hi>Vacuum:</hi> And nevertheleſs, though he was an <hi>Epicurean,</hi> yet that he might have the honour of giving a Beginning to the Principles of
<hi>Epicurus,</hi> that's to ſay, to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes;</hi> he hath ſuppoſed for the beginning of things, a Chaos of matter throughly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, which God divided into an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of little Squares, to every one of which he gave oppoſite Motions. Now he will have theſe Cubes, by rubbing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another, to have crumbled themſelves into pieces of all ſorts of Figures: But how can he conceive, that theſe ſquare Peices, could begin to turn ſeparately, without granting a Vacuity betwixt their Angles? Muſt there not be neceſſarily a Void in the ſpaces, which the Angles of theſe Squares were forced to leave, that they might move? And then could theſe Squares, which only poſſeſſed a certain Extent before they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, move in a Circle, unleſs in their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference they had poſſeſſed as much more? Geometry tells us, That that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be; one half then of that ſpace, ought neceſſarily to have remained void, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there were as yet no <hi>Atomes</hi> to fill it.</p>
                        <p>My Philoſopher made me anſwer, That <hi>Monſieur des Cartes</hi> himſelf would give us
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57769:162"/> a reaſon for that; and that being an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging Gentleman, as well as a Philoſopher, he would certainly be overjoyed to find a mortal Man in this World, that he might clear him of an Hundred Doubts, which his unexpected Death had conſtrained him to leave in the Earth, that now he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken: That he did not think though, there was any great difficulty to anſwer that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, according to his Principles which I had not examined, but as far as the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Wit could permit me; becauſe, ſaid he, the Works of that great Man, are ſo full and ſo ſubtile, that to underſtand them, there is need of the attention of the Soul of a true and conſummated Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher: Which is the reaſon, that there is not a Philoſopher in the Sun, but has a Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from him, inſomuch that they will not diſpute him the Precedency, if his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty ſuffer him to take it.</p>
                        <p>To eaſe the trouble that the length of this Journey may give you, we will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of his Philoſophy according to his Principles; which undoubtedly are ſo clear, and ſeem ſo abundantly ſatisfactory, through the admirable Wit of that great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, that one would ſay, He had aſſiſted in the lovely and magnificent Structure of this Univerſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="176" facs="tcp:57769:163"/> You remember, he ſaith, that our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is Finite; ſo Matter being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>in infinitum,</hi> it is not to be doubted, but that is one of the things, that it can neither imagine nor conceive; and that it is far above the reach of the Intellect, to give you a Reaſon for it: But, ſaid he, though that cannot fall under the Senſes, yet we conceive that it is ſo, by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have of Matter; and we ought not, ſaid he, ſuſpend our Judgments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things that we conceive. Can we imagine the manner how the Soul acts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Body? Nevertheleſs, that is a truth not to be denied, nor doubted of; whereas it is a far greater abſurdity to attribute to a <hi>Vacuity,</hi> that quality of yeilding to a Body, and that Space, which are the dependances of an Extent, which can only agree to a Subſtance; ſeeing by ſo doing one would confound the Notion of
<hi>Nothing</hi> with that of a <hi>Being,</hi> and give Qualities to that, which can produce nothing, and cannot be the Author of any thing whatſoever. But, poor Mortal, ſaid he, I perceive that theſe Speculations are tedious to thee; becauſe as that Excellent Man ſaith, Thou haſt never taken pains enough, to purifie thy Spirits from the maſs of thy Body; and becauſe thou haſt rendred it ſo lazy, that it will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form no Functions now, without the aid of Senſes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="177" facs="tcp:57769:163"/> I was about to reply, when he pulled me by the Arm, to ſhew me a Valley of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Beauty. Do you perceive, ſaid he to me, that bottom we are going down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? One would ſay, that the tops of the little Hills that bound it, were purpoſely Crown'd with Trees, that by the cool of their Shade, they would invite Travellers to repoſe.</p>
                        <p>At the foot of one of theſe Hills, the Lake of Sleep takes its ſource; it conſiſts only of the Liquor of five Fountains, and if it mingled not with Three Rivers, and by its weight dulled the ſtream of their Waters, no Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal of our World could ſleep. I cannot expreſs how impatient I was to queſtion him, about theſe Three Rivers, which I had never heard of before; but I was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied when he told me, that I ſhould ſee all.</p>
                        <p>Soon after we arrived in the Valley, and much about the ſame time, upon the Carpet that borders that great Lake.</p>
                        <p>The truth is, ſaid <hi>Campanella</hi> to me, you are happy, in that you ſee before you die, all the wonders of this World; it's a bleſſing for the Inhabitants of your Globe, that it hath produced a Man, who can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them of the marvels of the Sun; ſeeing without you, they were in danger of living in groſs Ignorance, and of taſting a thouſand
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57769:164"/> Pleaſures, without knowing whence they come; for it cannot be imagined, how li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally the Sun beſtows his Largeſſes, upon all your little Globes: and this Valley a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, diffuſes an infinite nnmber of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, throughout the whole Univerſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which you could not live, nor ſo much as ſee the Day: Methinks that the ſight of this Country alone, is enough to make you confeſs, that the Sun is your Father, and that he is the Author of all things. Theſe Five little Rivers, that come and diſcharge themſelves in it, run not above Fifteen or Sixteen hours; and nevertheleſs they ſeem to be ſo weary when they arrive, that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can they move; but they expreſs their Laſſitude by very different effects, for that of Sight contracts its ſelf proportionably, as it approaches to the Lake of Sleep. The Hearing at its Mouth, confounds, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and looſes it ſelf in the Pool: The Smelling raiſes a murmur, like that of a Man who ſnores: The Taſte growing wallowiſh by the way, becomes altogether inſipid: And the Feeling, ſo powerful a little before, that he lodged all his Comrades, is fain to conceal his own abode. On his part the Nymph of Peace, who reſides in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Lake, with open Arms receives his gueſts, lays them in her Bed, and dandles them ſo gingerly, that to make them ſleep,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57769:164"/> ſhe her ſelf takes the pains to rock the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. After they have for ſome time been thus confounded in this vaſt Baſon, they again divide themſelves at the further end, into Five Rivulets, which reſume the ſame names when they iſſue out, that they left when they entered: But thoſe which haſten moſt to be gone, and tug their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſet out, are the Hearing and Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for the other Three wait, till theſe awaken them, and of all the reſt the Taſte lags always hindmoſt.</p>
                        <p>The Lake of Sleep is Vaulted over, with the black Arch of a <hi>Grotto.</hi> A great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tortoiſes march ſlowly about the Shore; the Flowers of a Thouſand Poppies, by looking into the Water, communicate to it its drouzy virtue. Not ſo much as <hi>Dormice,</hi> but come above Fifty Leagues to drink in it; and the purling of the Stream is ſo charming, that it would ſeem to break upon the Pebbles with Cadence, and to endeavour to compoſe Soporifick Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.</p>
                        <p>The Wiſe <hi>Campanella</hi> without doubt foreſaw, that I was about to feel the effects of it, and therefore he adviſed me to mend my pace. I would have obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, but the Charms of that Water had ſo enveigled my Reaſon, that hardly could I underſtand his laſt Words. Sleep
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57769:165"/> on, then, ſleep on, I give you leave, ſaid he; and indeed the Dreams that one has here are ſo perfect, that you'll be glad one day to call to mind, that which you are about to have. In the mean time, I'll di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert my ſelf in viewing the Rarities of the place, and then come back to you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. I think he talked no more, or at leaſt the Vapours of ſleep, had already put me out of condition, of being able to hear him.</p>
                        <p>I was in the middle of the learnedeſt and beſt conceived Dream that ever was, when my Philoſopher came to awake me. I'll tell it you, when I can without digreſſion; for it is very important you ſhould know it, to let you ſee, with what freedom the Mind of the Inhabitants of the Sun acts, whilſt Sleep captivates their Senſes. For my part, I think, that that Lake evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates an Air, which hath the property of depurating the Mind, entirely from the Fogs of the Senſes; for nothing is preſented to your thoughts, which does not ſeem to perfect and inſtruct you; and that's the reaſon why I highly reſpect thoſe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, that are called Dreamers, who are laught at by the ignorant.</p>
                        <p>I opened then my Eyes with a ſtart: I fancy I heard him ſaying; Mortal, you have ſlept enough, riſe, if you would ſee
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57769:165"/> a Rarity that can never be imagined in your World. During the ſpace of an hour, or thereabouts, ſince I left you; I have been walking by the Five Fountains, which come out of the Lake of Sleep. You may believe, that I have conſidered them with a great deal of Attention; they bear the name of the Five Senſes, and glide very near one to another: That of the Sight ſeems to be a forked Pipe, full of the Powder of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, and little Looking-Glaſſes, that ſteal away and reſtore the Image of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever preſents; in its courſe it incompaſſes the Kingdom of <hi>Linx:</hi> That of the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is in like manner double; it turns by its Inſinuations like a <hi>Dedalus,</hi> and from the moſt hollow concavity of its Bed, one may hear an Eccho of all the noiſe that ſounds round about: I am much miſtaken, if they were not Foxes that I ſaw picking their Ears there: That of Smelling ſeems like the former, to divide it ſelf into two Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, hid under one and the ſame Arch; out of every thing it meets, it extracts ſomewhat inviſible, whereof it compoſes a Thouſand ſort of Odours, which ſtand it in ſtead of Water; on the brink of that ſource, there are a great many Dogs, that rub and cleanſe their Noſes. That of the Taſte runs by ſpurts, which commonly happen not above Three or Four times a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57769:166"/> Day, and for that too a large van of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral muſt be raiſed, and underneath that a great many little ones of Ivory; its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor reſembles Spittle: But as to the Fifth, that of Feeling, it is ſo large and deep, that it environs all its Siſters, nay, and lays it ſelf out at length in their Channels, and its thick Juyce, ſheds it ſelf abroad upon the green Turff, covered with ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Plants.</p>
                        <p>Now you muſt know, that ſtunned with Veneration, I admired the myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Turnings of all theſe Fountains: When after a great walk, I came to the entry where they diſcharged themſelves into Three Rivers: But follow me, you'll bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conceive the diſpoſition of theſe things when you ſee them. A Promiſe that pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me ſo well, throughly awoke me; I ſtretched out my Arm to him, and we kept the ſame way he had followed, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the Dykes that keep the Five Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets in their ſeveral Channels.</p>
                        <p>When we had gone about a Furlong, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as clear as a Lake preſented it ſelf to our Eyes. No ſooner had the Wiſe
<hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panella</hi> perceived it, but he told me: At length, Son, we are got to the Port, I diſtinctly ſee the three Rivers.</p>
                        <p>I was ſo briskly tranſported with that news, that I thought I was become an
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57769:166"/> Eagle. I flew rather than walked, and ran all about with ſo greedy a Curioſity, that in leſs than an hour, my Guide and I obſerved what now you ſhall hear.</p>
                        <p>Three great Rivers water the Fields of this Burning World: The Firſt and larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt is called Memory; the Second, narrower, but deeper, Imagination; and the Third, the laſt of the Three, is called Judgment.</p>
                        <p>Upon the Banks of Memory, one may hear continually a troubleſome chattering of Jays, Parrots, Magpies, Starlings, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, Chaffinches, and of all ſorts of Birds, that chirp what they have learnt. In the Night time they are ſilent, for then they are taken up in feeding upon that thick Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, which exhales from theſe watery places; but their foul Stomack digeſts it ſo ill, that in the Morning, when they think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into their ſubſtance, it drops out of their Beak again, as clear as it was in the River.</p>
                        <p>The Water of that River ſeems to be clammy, and runs with much noiſe.</p>
                        <p>The Ecchos that are formed in its Caverns repeat the word, even to above a Thouſand times: It breeds a kind of Monſters, who have a Face much like to that of a Woman. It hath others too more furious, who have a Square and Horned Head, not unlike to that of our Pedants. The whole Buſineſs of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57769:167"/> theſe is to cry, and nevertheleſs ſay no more but what they have heard one another ſay before.</p>
                        <p>The River of Imagination runs more gently; its light and ſhining Liquor ſparkles on all hands: To look upon that Water like a Torrent of humide ſparkles, one would think, that it obſerved no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in its courſe. After I had conſidered it more attentively; I obſerved that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which flowed in its Channel, was of pure Potable Gold, and its froth of the Oyl of Talc. The Fiſh that it feeds are <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moras, Syrenes</hi> and <hi>Salamanders;</hi> inſtead of Gravel, it is full of thoſe little Stones <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> ſpeaks of, with which Men become hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, when they touch their wrong ſide, and light when they apply to them their Right ſide. I obſerved there alſo thoſe other Stones, one of which <hi>Giges</hi> had in a ring, which render things Inviſible; but above all, there are a great many Philoſophers ſtones, which ſparkle amongſt its Sand. There were a great many Fruit-Trees up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the banks of it, eſpecially thoſe which <hi>Mahomet</hi> found in Paradiſe; their Branches ſwarmed with Phenixes, and I obſerved Crab-Stocks of that Tree, from which
<hi>Diſcord</hi> pluckt the Apple which ſhe threw amongſt the three Goddeſſes; graffs of the Garden of the <hi>Heſperides</hi> had been graffed on
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57769:167"/> them. Each of theſe Two great Rivers, is divided into an infinite number of Branches, that are interlaced one with another; and I took notice, that when a great Rivulet of Memory, drew near to a leſs of Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it immediately abſorbed the other; but on the contrary, if the Rivulet of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was the bigger, it dried up the Brook of Memory. Now ſeeing theſe Three Rivers, both in their Channels and Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, run always by one another; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Memory is ſtrong, the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diminiſhes; and this again ſwells, as the other is low.</p>
                        <p>Near to that the River of Judgment runs with an incredible ſlowneſs: It hath a deep Channel, its Liquor ſeems to be cold; and when it is ſhed upon any thing, it drys inſtead of moiſtening. In the Owze of its Channel grow Hellebore-Plants, whoſe Roots ſtretching out in long Filaments, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Mouth of it, purifie its Waters there: It breeds Serpents, and upon the ſoft graſs that cover its banks, Thouſands of Elephants repoſe themſelves: It is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as the other two, into an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of little Branches; it encreaſes as it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in its courſe: and though it ſtill gains ground, yet it continually ebbs and flows in it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="186" facs="tcp:57769:168"/> All the Sun is watered by the Juyce of theſe Three Rivers; it ſerves to ſteep the burning Atomes of thoſe that die in that great World; but this deſerves very well to be handled more largely.</p>
                        <p>The Life of the Animals of the Sun is very long, and they expire not but by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Death, which only happens at the end of Seven or Eight thouſand Years; when by the continued Intenſion of mind, to which their fiery temper inclines them, the order of matter is jumbled; for in a Body, ſo ſoon as Nature perceives, that it would require more time to repair the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Being, than to compoſe a new one, ſhe aſpires to Diſſolution; ſo that the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal may be ſeen daily not to Rot, but to fall into Particles like Red Aſhes.</p>
                        <p>Death never happens but in this manner. The Animal then being expired, or, to ſay better, extinct; the little igneous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that made up his ſubſtance, enter into the groſs matter of this burning World, until Chance hath watered them with the Liquor of the Three Rivers; for then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming moveable by their Fluidity, that they may quickly exert the Faculties, of which that Water hath given them an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Knowledge, they faſten together into threads, and by a Flux of Luminous points, ſharpen themſelves into Beams, and then
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57769:168"/> diſperſe into the Neighbouring Spheres; where they are no ſooner wafted, but they themſelves diſpoſe the matter, as much as they can, into a Form proper for the exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the functions, whereof they have contracted an Inſtinct, in the Water of the Three Rivers, the Five Fountains, and the Lake; and therefore they ſuffer themſelves to be attracted to Plants for Vegetation; the Plants ſuffer themſelves to be brouzed upon by Animals for Senſation; and the Animals ſuffer themſelves to be eaten by Men; that ſo being converted into their ſubſtance, they may repair the Three Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of Memory, Imagination and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of whoſe power the Rivers of the Sun, had given them a Fore-taſte.</p>
                        <p>Now according as the Atomes have been more or leſs ſoaked, in the Liquor of theſe Three Rivers; they furniſh Animals with more or leſs Memory, Imagination or Judgment; and according as in the Three Rivers, they have inbibed more or leſs, of the Liquor of the Five Fountains, and of the Lake, they form to them Senſes more or leſs perfect, and produce Souls more or leſs drowzy.</p>
                        <p>This is in a manner what we obſerved, concerning the nature of theſe Three Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Little ſcattered veines of them may be met with every where; but as for the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57769:169"/> principal Branches, they run with a ſtreight courſe to the Province of Philoſophers: And therefore we returned to the high way again, not leaving the Current wide of us, farther than it was neceſſary to get upon the Cauſey. We ſaw the Three great Rivers always running by our ſide; but for the Five Fountains, we beheld them turning and winding below in the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. That's a very pleaſant Road, though it be ſolitary; the Air there is pure and thin, which nouriſhes the Soul, and makes it reign over the Paſſions.</p>
                        <p>At the end of Five or Six days Journey, as we were diverting our ſight, with the various and rich Proſpects of the Country, we heard a languiſhing Voice, like the groaning of a ſick Perſon. We drew near the place, from whence we judged it might come, and found upon the brink of the River Imagination, an old Man fallen backwards, who complained grievouſly. Tears of compaſſion came into my Eyes, and Pity obliged me to ask the poor wretch what he ailed. That Man, anſwered <hi>Campanella,</hi> turning towards me, is a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher reduced to Extremity: For we die oftner than once; and ſeeing we are but parts of this Univerſe, we change our form, that we may go Live elſewhere; which is not a Misfortune, ſince it is a
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57769:169"/> way to perfect ones Being, and to attain to an infinite number of Sciences: His di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper is that, which makes all great Men for the moſt part to die.</p>
                        <p>His Diſcourſe obliged me to conſider the Patient more attentively, and at the firſt glance, I perceived that his Head was as big as a Tun, and open in many places. Come, come, ſaid <hi>Campanella</hi> to me, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me by the Arm, all the aſſiſtance that we may think we could give to this dying Man, would be unprofitable, and only trouble him the more. Let's Jog on, for indeed his Evil is Incurable: The Swelling of his Head, proceeds from the Reſtleſſneſs of his Mind; for though the Ideas, wherewith he has filled the Three Organs, or the Three Ventricles of his Brain, be but very ſmall Images; yet they are Corporeal, and by conſequence capable of filling a great place, when they are very numerous. Now you muſt know, That that Philoſopher hath ſo dilated his brain, by ſtuffing it with notion upon notion, that being unable longer to contain them, it hath burſt. That way of dying is common to great Genies, and it is called, To crack with Wit.</p>
                        <p>We marched on ſtill diſcourſing; and what preſented firſt to our view, furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with matter of Converſation. I ſhould have been very willing though, to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57769:170"/> have left the obſcure Regions of the Sun, and gone again into the Luminous; for the Reader muſt know, That all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are not Diaphanous, there are ſome of them that are obſcure, like thoſe of our World; and which, were it not for the light of the Sun, that is perceived beyond them, would be covered with Darkneſs. Now proportionably as one enters into the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Regions, he inſenſibly becomes ſo himſelf; and in the ſame manner, when one approaches the tranſparent, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf ſtript of that ſomber Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, by the vigorous Irradiation of the Climate.</p>
                        <p>I remember, that upon occaſion of this earneſt deſire I had, I asked <hi>Campanella,</hi> if the Province of Philoſophers was reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or darkiſh? It is more darkiſh than reſplendent, anſwered he: For as we ſtill Sympathize much with the Earth, our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, which of its own nature is Opacous; ſo we could not fit our ſelves in the clearer Regions of this Globe. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs by a vigorous bending of the Will, we can render our ſelves Diaphanous, when we have a mind to it: Nay, and moſt part of the Philoſophers, do not ſpeak with the Tongue, but when they have a mind to communicate their Thoughts, they purge themſelves by the Ejaculations
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57769:170"/> of their Fancy, of a ſomber Vapour, under which commonly they keep their Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions covered; and ſo ſoon as they have remanded to its place, that obſcurity of the Spleen which darkened them, ſeeing their Body is then Diaphanous, one may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive through their Brain what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, what they imagine, what they judge; and in their Liver and Heart, what they deſire, and what they reſolve: For though theſe little Pictures be more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible, than any thing that we can deviſe; yet in this World our Eyes are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted enough, eaſily to diſtinguiſh even the ſmalleſt Ideas.</p>
                        <p>Thus when any of us would diſcover to his Friend, the Affection he has for him, his Heart is perceived to dart out Beams, as far as his Memory, upon the Image of him he Loves: And when on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he would teſtifie his Averſion, his Heart is ſeen to Thunder againſt the Image of him he hates, ſtorms of burning Sparks, and to retreat backward as far as it can: In the ſame manner when he ſpeaks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, the Ideas are clearly to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that's to ſay, The Characters of every thing he meditates upon, which by riſing and falling, imprinting and effacing, preſent to the Eyes of the Beholder, not an articulated Diſcourſe, but a Hiſtory of all his thoughts in <hi>taille-doux.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="192" facs="tcp:57769:171"/> My Guide would have gone on, but he was diverted by an Accident, the like was never heard before: And that was, that all of a ſudden we perceived the Earth blacken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under our Feet, and the Heavens kindled before with Beams, extinguiſhed over head, as if a Canopy Four Leagues broad, had been ſpread betwixt us and the Sun.</p>
                        <p>It would be no eaſie matter for me to expreſs, what we imagined in that Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: All ſorts of Terrors, even that of the Worlds end, ſeized us, and none of theſe Apprehenſions ſeemed to us to be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; for to ſee night in the Sun, or the Air overcaſt with Clouds, is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle that never happens there. And yet this was not all; for immediately after a ſharp and skreaking noiſe, like to that of the winding up of a Jack, came to grate our Ears; and at the very ſame time a Cage fell at our Feet. No ſooner had it reſted upon the Sand, but it opened, and was brought to bed of a Man and a Woman; they had an Anchor with them, which they faſtened to the Roots of a Rock; the next thing they did, was to make towards us. The Woman led the Man, and with threats dragged him forward. When ſhe was come very near us, Gentlemen, ſaid ſhe, in ſome little diſorder, Is not this the Province of Philoſophers? I made anſwer, No; but
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57769:171"/> that we hoped to be there within the ſpace of Four and twenty hours; and that the old Man, who allowed me his Company, was one of the chief Miniſters of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. Seeing you are a Philoſopher, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Woman, addreſſing her ſelf to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panella,</hi> without going further, I muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my heart to you.</p>
                        <p>To tell you then in a few Words, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of my coming hither, you muſt know, that I come to complain of a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der committed on the perſon of the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of my Children; the Barbarian, whom I hold here, hath twice kill'd him, though he be the Father. We were extreamly puzled at this Diſcourſe, and therefore I deſired to know, what ſhe meant by a Child killed twice? Know, anſſered the Woman, that in our Country, amongſt the other Statutes of Love, there is a Law regulates the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Kiſſes, which a Husband is obliged to give his Wife: And it's for that reaſon, that every evening a Phyſician, within his own precinct, viſits all the Houſes, where having viewed the Husband and Wife, he taxes them for that night, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Health, ſtrong or weak, in more or leſs Embraces. Now my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band there was adjudged to Seven: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, being netled at ſome angry words I gave him, as we were going to Bed, he
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57769:172"/> did not ſo much as touch me, all the while we were in bed: But God, who avenges the cauſe of the afflicted, permitted, That that Wretch being tickled in a dream, by remembring the Kiſſes, which he unjuſtly detained from me, let a Man be loſt. I told you, that his Father hath killed him twice, becauſe by hindering him to be, he is the cauſe that he is not, there is his firſt Murder; and he is likewiſe the cauſe, why he hath not been, there's his ſecond: Whereas an ordinary Murderer knows very well, that he whom he deſtroys, is no more in being; but he cannot hinder, but that he hath had a Being. Our Magiſtrates would have rendred Juſtice in the matter; but the Crafty Man alledged for excuſe, That he would have performed his conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Duty, had he not been apprehenſive, that kiſſing me in the rage that I had put him into, he might have begot a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                        <p>The Senate puzled at that Plea, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us to go and appear before the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, and plead our Cauſe there. So ſoon as we received the Order to be gone, we put or ſelves into a Cage, hung by the Neck of that great Fowl, which you ſee there; from whence by means of a Pully which we faſtned to it, we let our ſelves down to the ground, and hoiſt our ſelves
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57769:172"/> up into the Air. There are people in our Province, purpoſely appointed to tame them when they are young, and breed them up to the work we employ them in. That which chiefly makes them tractable, contrary to their fierce nature, is, that to ſatisfie their unſatiable Hunger, we give them the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of all the Beaſts that die to feed on. After all, when we have a mind to ſleep, (for becauſe of the conſtant exceſſes of Love, which weaken us, we ſtand in need of Reſt:) We let looſe into the open Fields, at convenient diſtances, Twenty or Thirty of theſe Fowls, each tied to a rope, who tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flight with their great Wings, diſplay in the Sky a Night larger than the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon. I was very attentive both to her Diſcourſe, and in great extaſie, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the prodigious bulk of that Giant-Bird: But ſo ſoon as <hi>Campanella</hi> had lookt a little upon it, Ha! verily, cried he, it is one of thoſe Feathered Monſters called
<hi>Condores,</hi> which are to be ſeen in the Iſle of <hi>Mandragora</hi> in our World, and all over the Torrid Zone, they cover an Acre of ground with their Wings: But ſeeing theſe Animals grow Huger, according as the Sun, under which they are bred, is hotter in the World of the Sun, they muſt needs be of a prodigious Greatneſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="196" facs="tcp:57769:173"/> However, added he turning to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, you muſt of neceſſity accompliſh your Journey; for it belongs to <hi>Socrates,</hi> who hath the inſpection of Manners, to decide your Cauſe. In the mean time, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you to tell us, what Country you are of, becauſe ſeeing it is but three or four years, ſince I arrived in this World, I am but very little as yet acquainted with the Map of it?</p>
                        <p>We are, anſwered ſhe, of the Kingdom of Lovers: That great State is on one ſide bordered by the Republick of Peace, and on the other, by that of the Juſt.</p>
                        <p>In the Country I come from, at Sixteen years of Age, Boys are put into the Novitiat of Love: It is a very ſtately Palace, that takes up almoſt a quarter of the City. The Maids are put into it at Thirteen; and both accompliſh their year of Probation there; during which the Boys are only employed, in meriting the affection of the Girls, and the Girls in rendring themſelves worthy of the Love of the Boys. When the Twelve Months are up, the faculty of medicine in Body, go and viſit this Seminary of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: They feel them all over, one after another, even to the moſt Privy parts of their Body; make them couple before them; and then according as the Male, upon Tryal, is found to be vigorous and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57769:173"/> well-ſhaped, they give him for Wives, Ten, Twenty, Thirty or Forty Maids, ſuch as loved him; provided he reciprocally love them. The Husband, nevertheleſs, cannot lie but with Two at a time, and it is not lawful for him to Embrace any of them, ſo long as ſhe is with Child. Such as are found to be Barren, are only employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Service; and Men who are impotent are made Slaves, and may carnally mingle with the Female-Drudges. After all, when a Family hath more Children than it can bring up, the Republick takes care of them: But that's a misfortune that very ſeldom happens; becauſe ſo ſoon as a Woman is brought to Bed in the City, the publick Treaſury furniſhes a yearly Penſion for the Education of the Child, according to its Quality; which on certain days, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers of State themſelves, carry to the Houſe of the Father: But if you have a mind to know more, ſtep into our Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier, it is big enough for Four. Seeing we are going the ſame way, we'll talk and make our Journey the ſhorter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Campanella</hi> was of the mind, that we ſhould embrace the offer; and I was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very glad of it, to avoid being tired: But when I came to help them to weigh their Anchor, I was much ſurprized to find, that inſtead of a great Cable, which ought
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57769:174"/> to bear it up, it hung only by a Silken thread as ſmall as a Hair. I asked <hi>Campanella</hi> how it could be, that a Maſs ſo heavy as that Anchor was, did not by its weight break ſo weak a thing? And the good Man made anſwer, That that Line did not break, becauſe being ſpun all of an equal bigneſs, there was no reaſon why it ſhould ſooner break, at one place than another. We all ſtowed ourſelves into the Pannier, and then hoiſted up our ſelves by the Pully, as high as the Fowl's Throat, where we appeared no bigger than a Bead hanging at its Neck. When we were up as high as the Pully, we faſtened the Cable by which our Cage hung, to one of its ſmalleſt Down-feathers, which nevertheleſs was as big as ones Thumb; and ſo ſoon as the Woman, had made a ſign to the Bird to be gone, we perceived it cleave the Air with a violent Rapidity. The
<hi>Condore</hi> haſtned or ſlackened its flight, ſoared or ſtooped, according to its Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes pleaſure, whoſe Voice ſerved it for a Bridle. We had not flow'n Two hundred Leagues, when we perceived on the Earth, to the leſt Hand, a night like to that, which our living Umbrello made under us. We asked the ſtranger Woman, what ſhe thought it might be? It's another Malefactor, anſwered ſhe, who is going alſo to receive Juſtice in the Province, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57769:174"/> we are going: His Fowl, without doubt, is ſtronger than ours, or otherwiſe we have trifled away a great deal of time by the way, for he ſet not out till after I was gone. I asked her, what Crime that poor Wretch was accuſed of? He is not barely accuſed, anſwered ſhe; he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to dye, becauſe he is already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of not being afraid of Death. How then, ſaid <hi>Campanella</hi> to her, do the Laws of your Country enjoyn Men to be afraid of Death? Yes, replied the Woman, they enjoyn all, except thoſe who are admitted into the Colledge of the Wiſe; for our Magiſtrates have found by ſad Experience, that he who fears not to loſe Life, may take it from any Body elſe.</p>
                        <p>After ſome other diſcourſes that followed theſe,
<hi>Campanella</hi> had a mind to make a larger enquiry into the Manners of her Country: He asked her then, what were the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Kingdom of Lovers? But ſhe begged his pardon, if ſhe did not anſwer him; becauſe ſince ſhe was not born there, and knew them but in part, ſhe was afraid, ſhe might ſay too much or too little. I came into that Province, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Woman; but I and all my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, are originally of the Kingdom of Truth; my Mother was delivered of me there, and never had another Child; ſhe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57769:175"/> brought me up in the Country, till I was Thirteen Years of Age, when the King by the advice of Phyſicians, commanded her to carry me to the Kingdom of Lovers, from whence I come; to the end, that having my Breeding in the Palace of Love, that Education which is more chearful and ſoft, than the Breeding of our Country, might render me more Fruitful than ſhe had been. My Mother carried me thither, and placed me out into that Houſe of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                        <p>I had much ado to comply with their Cuſtoms: At firſt they appeared to me to be very rude; for, as you know, the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that we have ſuckt in with our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Milk, ſeem always to us to be the moſt rational; and then I was but juſt come from the Kingdom of Truth, my native Country.</p>
                        <p>Not but that I perceived very well, that the Nation of Lovers, lived with more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion and Indulgence, than ours did; for though every one gave it out, That my Sight wounded dangerouſly, that my Looks killed, and that my Eyes glanced out Flames, which conſumed Hearts; yet the Goodneſs of all, and eſpecially of the Young Men, was ſo great, that they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed, kiſſed and hugg'd me, inſtead of revenging the Evil that I had done them.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57769:175"/> Nay, I was even vexed with my ſelf, for the diſorders that I was the cauſe of; and that was the reaſon, that out of Pity I told them one day, That I was reſolved to run away. But alas! how can you ſave your ſelf, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they all, embracing my Neck, and kiſſing my Hands: Your Houſe is on all Hands beſet with Water; and ſo great the danger appears to be, that undoubtedly you and we both had been already drowned, without a Miracle.</p>
                        <p>How, ſaid I to our Hiſtorian, is the Country of Lovers then ſubject to Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? It may very well be ſaid to be, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe; for one of my Gallants (and that Man would not have deceived me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loved me) wrote to me, That for grief of my departure, he had ſhed an Ocean of Tears. I ſaw another who aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, That within the ſpace of three days, his Eyes had diſtilled a Fountain of Water: And as I was curſing, for their ſakes, the fatal Hour when firſt they ſaw me, one who reckoned himſelf of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of my Slaves, ſent me word, that the night before, an overflowing of his Eyes, had cauſed a Deluge. I was about to have left the World, that I might no longer be the cauſe of ſo many Evils, had not the Meſſenger ſubjoined, that his Maſter had charged him to aſſure me, That I had no
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57769:176"/> cauſe to fear any thing, ſeeing the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of his Breaſt, had dried up that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge. In fine, you may Conjecture how wateriſh the Kingdom of Lovers muſt needs be, ſince with them it is to weep but by halves; when from under their Eye-lids, there ſprings no more but Rivulets, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Torrents.</p>
                        <p>I was in great pain, what Machine I could find, to ſave my ſelf out of all theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that were like to over-whelm me: But one of my Lovers, who was called <hi>The Jealous,</hi> adviſed me to pluck out my Heart, and then embark in it; that I needed not fear, but that it would hold me, becauſe it held ſo many others; nor that I ſhould ſink, becauſe it was too light: That all I was to be afraid of, was to be burnt, becauſe the Materials of ſuch a Veſſel, was much ſubject to Fire: That I ſhould be gone then upon the Sea of his Tears; that the Fillet of his Love, would ſerve me for a Sail; and that the favourable Gale of his Sighs, in ſpight of his Rivals Storm, would carry me to Shoar.</p>
                        <p>I was a long while a muſing with my ſelf, how I could put that enterpriſe into execution. The natural Fearfulneſs of my fex, hindred me from daring; but at length the opinion that I had, that if the thing were not feaſible, a Man would not
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57769:176"/> be ſuch a Fool as to adviſe it, and far leſs a Lover to his Miſtreſs, gave me the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p>I ſnatched a knife, ſlit up my Breaſt; nay, with both my hands I was already ſearching in the wound, and with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted look, I felt for my Heart to pluck it out, when a Young Man, who loved me, came in. In ſpight of me he wreſted the Weapon from me, and then asked me the motive of that deſperate Action, as he called it. I gave him an account of it; but was much ſurprized, when within a quarter of an hour after, I underſtood that he had brought the <hi>Jealous</hi> before the Juſtice. Nevertheleſs the Magiſtrates, who, perhaps, feared they might be biaſſed by the example or novelty of the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, referred that Cauſe to the Parliament of the Juſt. There he was Condemned, beſides perpetual Baniſhment, to go end his Days as a Slave, in the Land of the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi> of <hi>Truth;</hi> with prohibition to all that ſhould deſcend of him, to the Fourth Generation, ever to return into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Lovers; nay, moreover he was enjoyned upon pain of Death, never more to uſe an Hyperbole.</p>
                        <p>Since that time I entertained a great affection for the Young Man that ſaved me; and whether it were for that good
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57769:177"/> Office, or becauſe of the Paſſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ſerved me, when my Novitiat and his were out, I did not refuſe him, when he demanded me for one of his Wives.</p>
                        <p>We have always ſince lived very well together, and ſhould have continued to do ſo ſtill, had he not, as I have told you, killed one of my Children twice; for which I am going to emplore Juſtice, in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Philoſophers.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Campanella</hi> and I were much aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſilence of that Man; and therefore I endeavoured to comfort him, judging, that ſuch a profound Taciturnity, was the Daughter of a very deep Remorſe: But his Wife took me off of that. It is not, ſaid ſhe, the exceſs of Sorrow that ſtops his Mouth, but our Laws forbid all Criminals, that ſtand Indited, to ſpeak unleſs it be before their Judges.</p>
                        <p>During that converſation, the Fowl was going on ſtill, but I was ſtrangely amazed when I heard <hi>Campanella,</hi> with a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance full of tranſports of Joy, cry out: Now welcome the deareſt of all our Friends: Let's go, Gentlemen, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the good Man, Let's go meet
<hi>Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur Des Cartes;</hi> come let us alight, he is juſt now arrived, and but Three Leagues off. For my part, I was exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurprized at this Eruption, for I could
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57769:177"/> not comprehend, how he could come to know the arrival of a Man, of whom we had received no News. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, ſaid I to him, you have juſt now ſeen him in a Dream. If you call a Dream, ſaid he, what your Soul can ſee with as great a certainty, as your Eyes ſee the light of Day; I confeſs it. But, cried I, is it not a Ravery to think, that <hi>Monſieur Des Cartes,</hi> whom you have not ſeen, ſince you left the World of the Earth, is now but Three Leagues off, becauſe you have imagined it to be ſo?</p>
                        <p>I had juſt uttered the laſt Syllable, when we ſaw
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> come. Immediately <hi>Campanella</hi> ran to embrace him: They talked together a long while; but I could not mind all the obliging Complements they made to one another, I was ſo full of deſire to learn of
<hi>Campanella</hi> his Secret of Divination. That Philoſopher, who read my Paſſion in my looks, gave his Friend an account of it, and prayed him not to take ill if he ſatisfied me. <hi>Monſieur Des Cartes</hi> anſwered with a ſmile, and my learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Preceptor diſcourſed in this manner. Out of all Bodies <hi>Species</hi>'s exhale, that's to ſay, Corporeal Images, which dance in the Air. Now theſe Images ſtill retain, notwithſtanding their Agitation, the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, Colour, and all the other Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57769:178"/> of the Object, from which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed: But ſeeing they are very pure and ſubtile, they paſs through our Organs, without cauſing the leaſt Senſation in them: They penetrate into the Soul, where becauſe of the Delicateneſs of its Subſtance, they imprint themſelves, and ſo repreſent to it Objects very remote, which the Senſes cannot perceive. It's a thing that commonly happens here, where the mind is not ſhut up in a Body, made of groſs Matter, as in thy World. We'll tell thee how that comes to paſs, when we have had the leiſure, fully to ſatisfie the mutual Deſire, that each of us have, to converſe with the other; for certainly thou well deſerveſt to be uſed with the greateſt Civility.</p>
